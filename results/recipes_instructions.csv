https://www.recipetineats.com/mushroom-gravy-smothered-rissoles/, Mix rissole ingredients; form 12 patties; slightly indent one side. Cook in 2 batches until lightly browned but raw inside. Wipe pan clean; melt butter; cook onion; then mushrooms; add garlic towards end. Make roux then gravy. Cook rissoles in gravy as it thickens; 4 – 5 minutes; serve! Grate the onion into a large bowl; add panko; toss to soak in the onion juices. Add remaining rissole ingredients and mix well with your hands. Dented patties – Form 12 patties (1/4 cup each) and make a slight indentation on one side (this prevents doming while cooking). Lightly brown – Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large non-stick pan (30cm/12") over medium high heat. Cook half the rissoles for 1 1/2 minutes on each side until lightly browned but still raw inside. Remove onto a plate. Add the remaining oil and repeat with remaining rissoles. Clean pan – Discard excess oil and give the pan a rough clean with paper towels; just to remove most of the black bits. Cook mushrooms – Melt the butter in the same pan; cook the onion for 1 minute; then add the mushrooms and cook for 3 – 4 minutes until they release water; soften; then become lightly browned. Add the garlic for the last 30 seconds. Cook off flour – Turn the heat down to medium; scatter flour across the surface and stir for 1 minute – it will be like a dry paste. Half beef stock – While stirring; pour in half the stock then keep mixing until the flour paste dissolves and thickens the liquid; and is lump free (about 30 seconds). Simmer rissoles and thicken gravy – Add remaining stock; Worcestershire sauce; salt and pepper. Stir; turn heat up slightly to medium high. When it starts simmering; gently place the rissoles in (including any juices pooled on the plate). Cook rissoles 4 – 5 minutes until the liquid thickens into a thin gravy (aim for thinner than you want; thickens as you serve). Serve rissoles over mash with plenty of sauce! Add a sprinkle of parsley if you're feeling fancy.
https://www.recipetineats.com/peanut-butter-stuffed-brownies/, Save 2 tbsp peanut butter for swirling; warm to loosen then freeze rest in lined pan. Melt butter and chocolate; mix in sugar; then eggs + vanilla; then flour + cocoa + salt. Pour half in pan; top with peanut butter slab; cover with remaining batter; swirl through warmed reserved peanut butter. Bake 32 min at 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Cool 1 hr on counter; 3 hrs+ in fridge; cut. Line pan – Grease a 20cm/8" square pan with butter then line with baking paper (parchment).  Frozen peanut butter slab – Set aside 2 tablespoons of the peanut butter for the swirls. Warm the remaining peanut butter in the microwave to loosen (~30 sec on high); then pour into the pan. Spread evenly; sprinkle with half the sea salt flakes. Freeze for 2 – 3 hours until it's so firm you can pick it up. Lift out of pan using the paper; then put it back in the freezer on the paper while you make the batter (it softens quickly).  Line pan again with baking paper; with overhang so you can lift the brownie out.  Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan forced). Melt – Place butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Microwave in 30 second bursts; stirring in between (takes me 1m 30 sec) until melted and smooth. Stir to combine. Batter – Add sugar; mix; then add eggs and vanilla and mix well until smooth and molten. Add flour; cocoa and salt. Stir until smooth.  Stuff – Pour half the batter into the pan. Top with frozen peanut butter slab; spread with remaining batter. Swirl – Randomly dollop/drizzle the 2 tbsp peanut butter across the surface. Use a butter knife or teaspoon to make random swirls; make grooves if needed to reveal brownie batter – Note 3 for tips! Bake for 32 minutes. The middle will still jiggle (it sets when cool) but the edges should be firmish. Set –  Cool in the pan on the counter for an hour; then refrigerate for at least 3 hours to let it properly set; else the peanut butter will ooze out when cutting. Cut into 16 squares. Let it come to room temperature for 15 minutes+ then devour! Store in an airtight container in a cool; dry place.
https://www.recipetineats.com/duchess-potato-chicken-mushroom-pie/, Brown mushrooms; remove; sear chicken (aggressively!) in same pan; cut into large pieces. Sauté bacon; onion and garlic; deglaze with Guinness; make roux; add stock; simmer with mushrooms to thicken (~10 min). Add chicken towards end. Pour into a baking dish; pipe on mashed potato; finish with butter and parmesan; bake 30 min.  Garlic butter mushrooms – Melt 1/4 of the butter in a large 30cm/12" non stick pan over high heat. Add mushrooms; toss for 3 – 4 minutes until you get some browning on the surface. Add another 1/4 of the butter; melt; toss to coat. Add 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper and half the garlic; toss 30 seconds until garlic is golden – mushrooms will still be hard inside; they finish cooking later. Remove into bowl (make sure you scrape out all garlic bits). Sear chicken – Sprinkle the chicken with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  In the same pan; melt another 1/4 of the butter until hot and foamy. Sear chicken 2 minutes on each side until nicely golden but inside is still raw (if they don't fit in a single layer; do in batches). Remove onto plate; once cool enough to handle cut into 2.5cm (1") pieces. Bacon and onion – In the same pan; add bacon and stir for 15 seconds; then add the onion (there should be enough fat from the chicken). Cook for 2 minutes until the onion edges are golden and starting to soften. Add remaining garlic and stir 20 seconds. Deglaze with Guinness – Add Guinness and let it simmer rapidly; scraping the base of the pan to loosen any golden bits into the liquid (“fond” = free flavour!); until the Guinness is reduced down by 75%. Sauce – Lower heat to medium and add remaining butter. Once melted; sprinkle flour all across the surface and stir for 1 minute – it will look pasty. While stirring; pour in half the stock. Keep stirring  until the flour paste dissolves into the stock; for lump-free sauce (yay!). Then add remaining stock; water; tomato paste; 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper; stir well. Simmer –  Add the mushrooms plus all mushroom juices accumulated in the bowl into the pan. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid reduces down into a fairly thick gravy and the mushrooms become soft. (Meanwhile; start the mash) Thicken sauce – Add the chicken (plus all juices) and simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes until the gravy is quite thick and you can draw a path on the base of the pan. (Sauce thickness now = sauce thickness once baked). Taste – add more salt if needed (I don’t). Assemble – Pour into a 1.5 – 2 L (6 – 8 cup) baking pan and smooth the surface. (Note 5 for other pan sizes) Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan-forced). Duchess potato topping – Pipe mounds of mashed potato swirls on the surface. My swirls have a 4.5cm base (1.6"); about 4cm tall (1.4"); then I fill gaps with small swirls/blobs. I use all the mash! Drizzle with melted butter; sprinkle with parmesan. (Note 6 for no piping bag) Bake for 30 minutes; rotating the pan at the 20 minute mark. Serve – Rest for 10 minutes; sprinkle with parsley if using. Attack! Make mash – Put the potatoes into a large pot of cold tap water. Bring to a boil over high heat then cook for 15 minutes until soft. Drain; pass through a potato ricer (smoother) or mash well with a potato masher in the now empty pot. Add butter; milk; 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp white pepper; stir through – it should be creamy but not loose (so it holds its form when piped). Piping bag – Transfer mash into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. (Note 6 for no piping bag) 
https://www.recipetineats.com/texan-bbq-candied-nuts/, Simmer candied coating 2 min; toss with nuts; bake 20 min at 180°C/350°F (160°C fan); tossing halfway. Break up while warm; fully cool. Attack! Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Line a large tray with foil then baking paper (parchment). Nuts – Put the nuts in a bowl. Candied coating – Put the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once mostly melted; add all the remaining candied coating ingredients. Stir; then once it comes to a simmer; reduce stove to medium low so it's simmering gently for 2 minutes; stirring regularly so it doesn’t catch. Toss – Pour over the nuts; toss well – take about 30 seconds; use a rubber spatula. It should be quite thick and coat the nuts well; no runny caramel pooling at bottom of bowl. Bake – Spread on tray; bake for 20 minutes; tossing well at the halfway mark; until the nuts are deep golden. There should be hardly any candy coating liquid left on the tray. Break up – Cool undisturbed on the tray for 10 minutes then break it up while still warm (separates better). Then leave to fully cool on the tray – the candy coating will fully harden (about 30 minutes). (Note 4 if nut surface is not shiny smooth) Uses – Serve in bowls for snacking (brilliant bar snack); fill jars for gifting; add to platters; chop and sprinkle on salads. Adding a sprinkle of sea salt is a nice finishing touch.
https://www.recipetineats.com/red-velvet-cheesecake/, Inverted pan base – Flip the base of a 20cm / 8" springform pan upside down – this makes it easier to remove the finished cheesecake without the lip in the way. Very lightly butter the pan base; then press on a square sheet of baking paper. Clip the pan sides onto the base; letting the excess paper stick out the sides (for easy removal later). Butter and line the pan sides with more baking paper. Blitz cookies – Roughly break up Oreos with hands and place in food processor. Blitz until they become fine crumbs. Add melted butter; then blitz again until combined.  Press into pan – Transfer crumbs into prepared pan; pressing evenly and firmly on to the base (I use the underside of a straight-sided; flat-bottomed cup measure to do this). Bloom gelatine – Place water in a small bowl then sprinkle the gelatine powder across the surface. Stir to partly dissolve. Set aside 5 minutes. It will turn into a solid rubber; this process is called blooming. Microwave the gelatine for 15 seconds to turn it into liquid; stir; then let it stand for 3 to 5 minutes to cool. But it MUST be liquid when added into the mixture (else you'll end up with gelatine lumps); so re-melt if needed. Whip the cream until stiff peaks form (2 – 3 minutes on high). Whip cream cheese – In a separate bowl (no need to clean beaters); beat the cream cheese and sugar for 2 minutes on high until fluffy and smooth. Add the cooled gelatine liquid and vanilla; beat another 30 seconds to mix it through well. Make it red! Add the lukewarm melted chocolate and red food colouring. Beat well for 1 minute until well combined. It should be a dark; seductive scarlet red colour rather than bright red; bearing in mind the cream will lighten it a bit. Fold in cream – Add one third of the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and gently fold until just combined. Then fold in the remaining cream. Transfer to cake pan – Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and place in the fridge for at least 6 hours to set. Remove cheesecake – Release the sides of the springform pan. Use the paper to slide the cheesecake off the base onto a serving platter. Peel the paper off the sides; then slide the paper out from under the cake. Whip cream – Place the cream; sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Beat on high for 2 minutes until softly whipped. (See here for make-ahead stabilised whipped cream option). Decorate – Pile the whipped cream on the cheesecake in the middle; leaving a 2.5cm/1" border. Sprinkle with shaved chocolate. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/stabilised-whipped-cream/, Put the cream; cream stabiliser; vanilla; and sugar or icing sugar in a bowl. Beat for 2 minutes on high until soft peaks form (or a little longer if you want stiff peaks). Ready for use! Holds its structure for up to 3 days in the fridge. Place the cream; mascarpone; and icing sugar or sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Beat until it is the stiffness you are after (1 1/2 minutes if you want soft peaks (kind of dollops) or 2 minutes for stiff peaks (for piping). Holds its structure for up to 3 days in the fridge. Place the water in a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatine over. Mix to dissolve then leave for 5 minutes to bloom – it will turn into a rubbery lump. Microwave for 10 to 15 seconds to melt. Stir in 1 tbsp cream to cool it down. Put the cream; vanilla; and sugar or icing sugar in a bowl. Beat for 1 minute until quite foamy; then add the gelatine liquid. Keep beating until it is the stiffness you are after – about 30 seconds for soft peaks; or 1 minute for stiff peaks. Use immediately as you would regular cream (eg decorating cakes; piping; spreading). Keep for use later – immediately transfer into a piping bag or bowl for use the next day. Important: DO NOT STIR before use; it breaks the cream and makes it watery.
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-zucchini-tots-mini-fritters/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan-forced) Sweat zucchini – Grate the zucchini using a standard box grater. Place into a large colander; sprinkle with the salt; toss with your fingers and leave to sweat for 30 minutes. Squeeze out liquid – Working a handful at a time; squeeze out the excess water (as much as you can) and place the zucchini in a bowl. Tots batter – Add the Batter ingredients except the feta and mix well to combine. Add the feta and gently stir through. Form tots – Dollop heaped tablespoons 2 trays lined with baking paper / parchment paper (I get 29 in total). Then use your fingers to shape them into cylinder "tater-tot / potato gem" shapes. Bake – Spray generously with oil. Bake for 30 minutes; swapping the trays at around 20 minutes (for extra golden; spray again with oil); or until golden brown and a crunchy crust forms on the surface. The tray on the bottom might need a few extra minutes. Serve with Minted Yogurt; lemon wedges and sprinkled with fresh oregano leaves if using. Mix together ingredients and set aside for at least 10 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-scones/, Pulse dry ingredients once; butter 4 times; cheese once. Add milk while pulsing 8–10 times. Shape into 3cm / 1.2" thick disc on baking paper; brush with milk; top with cheese; cut into 6 wedges. Space 5cm/2" apart on tray. Bake 20 min at 200°C/390°F (180°C fan); rest 5 min. Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan-forced). Blitz dry – Put flour; baking powder and salt in a food processor with a standard "S" blade. Pulse once. Add butter; pulse 4 to 5 times until the largest butter pieces you see are pea size. (You can also do this by hand – see Note 3) Add cheese; pulse once just to mix through a bit. Pour milk through the feeding tube while pulsing 8 to 10 times until the flour is just incorporated; then stop straight away. The dough will be shaggy rather than smooth; and it should be a bit sticky but can be handled. Bring dough together – Scatter a work surface with 1 tsp flour. Scrape the dough out of the food processor then bring together into a ball with your hands. Try to avoid using extra flour; but dust with more if needed (I don’t). 6 wedges – Put it on a sheet of baking paper; pat and shape into 3cm / 1.2" thick round disc. Brush with milk (top and sides); sprinkle with cheese; lightly press in. Cut into 6 wedges. (Note 4 for rounds) Bake – Transfer to baking tray. Pull each wedge out a bit so they are 5cm/2" apart. Bake 20 minutes until the surface is golden. Cool 5 minutes on the tray; then enjoy warm with a smear of butter!

Then add the remaining sauce and toss again until it's all evenly coated and no liquid remains (~ 1 minute); adding chilli crisp towards the end; if using. (Note 4) Serve – Toss through the green part of the green onion until it's wilted (barely 20 seconds); then divide between bowls. Noodle slurping time!
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-sausage-breakfast-hash/, Bake seasoned potatoes 15 minutes at 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Toss capsicum and onion with oil; salt & pepper; add to tray; toss. Dot with sausage meat (squeeze out); sprinkle with bacon; bake 35 minutes; tossing at the 20 minute mark. Reduce oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Make wells; crack in eggs; bake 7 minutes or until set to your taste. Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan-forced). Toss the potatoes with the oil and seasoning in a bowl. Spread on a lined tray; just big enough to hold everything in snugly rather than spread in a single layer (Note 3). Bake for 15 minutes. Capsicum and onion – Meanwhile; in the still-dirty potato bowl; toss the capsicum and onion with the oil; salt and pepper. Add to tray; then toss with the potatoes.  Sausage & bacon – Squeeze dollops of the sausage meat out of the casings and dot them randomly on top (you could cut the sausages using a knife; but that just isn't as fun). Scatter with bacon. Bake 35 minutes – Bake 20 minutes. Toss; then bake for a further 15 minutes; or until potatoes are soft. Lower oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Eggs – Push the potato aside to make holes for the eggs. Crack eggs in. Return to oven for 7 minutes or until eggs are done to your liking (I like runny yolks which means just-set whites!). Serve – Scatter with parsley; then serve!

Simmer to brown – Put the butter in a silver saucepan or small pan over medium high heat. Once melted; let it simmer (as in; bubbling) for 4 to 5 minutes; stirring every now and then; until it gets real foamy; you see little golden specks (wade through foam to see); it smells nutty & extra buttery. Cool – Immediately pour into a heatproof bowl; including all those golden specks; scraping out every bit of butter. Cool to room temperature (~45 minutes); cool enough so it won't melt the choc chips (Note 6) Whisk Dry ingredients and Spices in a separate bowl. Mix Wet – To the browned butter; add both sugars and mix with a wooden spoon. Add the egg; yolk and vanilla. Mix until smooth – it will look like caramel. Finish dough – Add the Dry ingredients and mix until the flour is mostly incorporated. Add the choc chips and stir until the flour is fully incorporated. Stuff – Measure out 8 x 125g portions of dough (4.4 oz/ heaped 1/3 cup); press dough together into a rough ball. Flatten; top with frozen Biscoff; enclose and shape into a ball with a flat base (ie tall dome); sealing cracks to avoid Biscoff leakage. Alternative: Break each into 2 balls; flatten both; sandwich Biscoff in between then fold up sides to enclose. You'll figure out the best method! Fridge 12 hours (min 2 hrs) – Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for 12 hours; up to 48 hours. BARE MINIMUM is 2 hours or until dough is firm! (Note 8) Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F oven (170°C fan-forced). (Note 9) Place fridge-cold cookies 7.5 cm/3" apart on a tray lined with baking paper/parchment paper. (I do 4 cookies on each tray) Bake for 18 – 19 minutes or until the edges are golden and the surface is cooked (ie not melty raw dough) but still pale.  Decorate and cool – Working quickly; press extra choc chips on the surface (Note 10); then cool on the tray for 20 minutes – finishes baking; edges crisp more and they get more golden all over.Tip: While hot; you can also reshape with a rubber spatula or similar into a tidy round shape. Grab now – peak eating moment! Or; transfer to a rack to cool fully before storing in an airtight container. 
https://www.recipetineats.com/maple-sweet-potato-salad-with-whipped-tahini/, Preheat the oven to 220°C/450°F (200°C fan). Arrange the oven racks so they are 20 cm/8" apart (for air circulation).

Put on a paper lined tray; then toss with the maple syrup; olive oil; salt and pepper. Lay sweet potato wedges on their side.  Chickpeas – Drain the chickpeas then spread on a tray (still wet).  Baking – Put both trays in the oven (sweet potato on the top shelf). Roast the potatoes for 30 minutes; turning them at the halfway mark. Take the chickpeas out after 10 minutes to flavour them. Crispy seasoned chickpeas – Remove the oven dried chickpeas from the oven after 10 minutes (Note 4). Push them to one side of the tray; drizzle/sprinkle and toss with the oil; spices; salt and pepper. Toss well using a rubber spatula; then return to the oven for a further 15 – 20 minutes until they're crispy (they will clatter! Note 4). Sweet potato charring (optional) – After 30 minutes (or when the potatoes are soft); switch the oven grill/broiler to high. Tuck in or fold down excess paper around the tray edges (so it doesn't touch heat element and catch fire). Stand the wedges sharp edge facing up; then pop it under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes until a bit charred on the edges. ⚠️ SAFETY NOTE: Do not walk away; make sure the paper does not catch fire. Whipped tahini yogurt sauce – While the potatoes are roasting whisk ingredients in a heat-proof bowl just to combine. When ready to use; microwave for just 30 seconds on high; then whisk again for 10 seconds – it will resemble softly whipped cream. (Note 5)  Optional tahini drizzle – Remove 1/4 cup of the tahini sauce and loosen with a little water to a drizzle-able consistency. Assemble – Spread the whipped tahini on a large plate. Pile the sweet potato on; mostly in a single layer. Drizzle with the tahini drizzle (if using); the spicy maple sauce; sprinkle with most of the pistachio and coriander. Sprinkle over chickpeas; then sprinkle with the remaining coriander and pistachios. EAT! (PS Great served warm or at room temperature)

(Note 2) Bake for 40 to 45 minutes; or until the internal temperature is 50°C/122°F (for medium rare; see Note 3 for other doneness).  Rest – Take the tray out of the oven and leave the steak on the counter for 10 minutes. (Internal temperature should rise by 3 degrees). Preheat the BBQ on high until it's screaming hot. Use the flat plate side if you're not a confident BBQ'er; or the grill side if you're a BBQ master. (Note 4)  Oil – Drizzle the oil on the steak and lightly pat to spread (don't rub off the salt); using most of the surface area of the meaty part. Turn BBQ DOWN – If using the grill side; reduce to low (if yours is strong; mine is) or medium low (for weaker ones). If using the flat plate side; lower to medium. Do this just before putting the tomahawk on. Edges first – Using tongs; hold the steak upright and sear the edges and bone first (only if you've got meat on it); rotating and moving every minute or so to achieve this all the way around. ⚠️Flare-ups – If searing on the grill side; don’t walk away – flare-ups are inevitable. See Note 4 for managing.  Steak crust – Then place the steak down on the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side; or until the internal temperature is 55°C / 131°F. For classic X grill lines; rotate once 45° partway through. Rest the steak on a rack for 3 minutes – the internal temperature will rise to 57°C/135°F which is perfect medium rare. Serve – Cut into 1 cm / 0.4" thick slices. Serve with steak sauce of choice! (Pictured: Cowboy Butter; highly recommend!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/cowboy-butter/, Sauté garlic – In a small frying pan; melt 1 tbsp (15g) of butter over medium heat until it starts foaming then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds while stirring until it becomes very; very light golden. Remove from the stove and let it cool for 3 minutes (the garlic will go more golden). Mix – Put the rest of the butter and remaining ingredients in a small mixing bowl. Pour the garlic butter over. Mix until combined. Serve with steak! It's also excellent with other cooked meats; seafood and even vegetables. I like to use it softened as it melts thicker over hot steak. You can also melt gently then dip bites of steak in; or roll it into a log using cling wrap; refrigerate then cut slices off on an as-need basis (you can place the coins on the steak to let it melt).
https://www.recipetineats.com/country-harvest-root-vegetable-soup/, Sauté – Put the olive oil and butter in a large heavy-based pot over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted; cook the onion and garlic for 2 minutes until the onion is softened. Add root vegetables; thyme and curry powder. Cook for three minutes stirring regularly; until the outside of the vegetables starts to soften. Simmer 15 minutes – Turn stove up to high. Add water; salt and pepper. Stir; then once it comes to a simmer; lower heat to medium high and simmer rapidly for 15 minutes (no lid) until all the vegetables are soft (check with knife). Stir in cream; simmer for 1 minute. Blitz – Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blitz until smooth. (Note 5 for blender) Adjust to taste – water to thin; salt and pepper if needed; extra cream for more indulgent. Serve in bowls. Drizzle with cream; pinch of curry powder; parsley and pepper. Serve with warm crusty bread!
https://www.recipetineats.com/puttanesca-fish-tray-bake/, Preheat oven to 220°C/390°F (200°C fan-forced). Roast potatoes: In a large mixing bowl; toss the potatoes with the oil; salt and pepper. Spread on a baking tray with a rim at least 2cm/0.8" high (or 23x33cm / 9×13" pan). Roast for 20 minutes. Puttanesca sauce: Meanwhile; mix all the sauce ingredients together (use the potato bowl; no need to clean). Add to the tray; toss with the potatoes; return to the oven for 10 minutes. Season fish: Pat the fish dry with paper towels. Sprinkle each side with the salt and pepper. Bake fish: Place fish on top of puttanesca sauce. Drizzle all over with the 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil. Bake 15 minutes or until fish is just cooked through (it should flake easily). Serve: Remove from the oven. Drizzle with a bit more olive oil; scatter with basil and reserved fennel fronds. Serve with warm; crusty bread!
https://www.recipetineats.com/b85-beef-sausage-rolls/, Toss grated onion and panko; then mix everything else except cheeses. Then mix in cheese. Divide in 2; wrap in pastry; seal with egg white. 3 slits; brush with yolk; sprinkle with sesame. 35 minutes at 200°C/425°F (180C fan) then 15 minutes on a rack. Preheat oven 200°C/425°F (180C fan-forced). Onion soak – Grate the onion in a bowl using a box grater; reserving all the onion juices. Add panko breadcrumbs and toss to wet. Everything else but cheese – Then add beef; egg; garlic; stock cube; salt; pepper and jalapeño. Mix well with hands to combine. "Crumble" in cheese – Add cheeses; then use fingers to firstly “crumble” the cheese through the beef before mixing well with hands (this method prevents cheese from clumping together). Roll – Barely thaw puff pastry (stiffer = easier to handle). Divide meat into 2 equal logs. Roll up in the puff pastry; then overlap the base with double layer; sealing with egg white. Finish with the seam side down and trim off surplus puff pastry (about 2 cm/0.8"). Finish sausage rolls – Cut each log in half. Cut 3 diagonal slashes on the top of each sausage roll. Brush with egg yolk; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake – Place the sausage rolls on a paper lined tray. Bake for 35 minutes; then transfer onto rack (to elevate out of fat; Note 5). Bake a further 15 minutes until pastry is deep golden and underside is crispy. Cool on rack 5 minutes before attacking! Serve with Aussie tomato sauce or ketchup.
https://www.recipetineats.com/melting-afghani-chickpea-curry/, Sauté – Melt the ghee in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the cinnamon and toast for 30 seconds. Add the onion; ginger; garlic and bay leaves. Cook for 3 minutes until the onion is translucent (stir regularly so the garlic & ginger don't catch). Spices and lentils – Add the Spices and stir for 30 seconds. Add the lentils and stir to coat in the spices. Simmer lentils – Add the stock and salt. Stir; bring to a simmer. Lower the head to medium; put the lid on and simmer for 15 minutes. Simmer chickpeas – Add the chickpeas; water and baking soda. Increase the heat to make it simmer again. Then lower the stove slightly and leave to simmer gently for 30 minutes without a lid or until the lentils mostly broken down to make a thin gravy (you can cook an extra 10 minutes to thicken more if you want). Serve with rice on the side and Afghan or other flatbreads for dunking; drizzled with yogurt and sprinkled with fresh coriander if you want (I do).
https://www.recipetineats.com/whipped-ricotta-one-pot-chicken-pasta/, Whipped ricotta – Put the ingredients in a bowl. Whisk vigorously for 10 to 15 seconds until it becomes the texture of softly whipped cream. Add milk to loosen; if needed. Seal chicken – Heat sun dried tomato oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add the chicken. sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes until the outside is sealed but the inside is still raw. Remove with slotted spoon into a bowl. Sauté – In the same pot; add the onion and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add the tomato paste and oil drained sun dried tomatoes (reserve any remaining oil for another use). Cook for 1 minute. Deglaze – Add white wine and let it simmer rapidly for 1 – 2 minutes; stirring regularly; until mostly evaporated. Cooking liquid – Add pasta and cooked chicken along with any juices accumulated in the bowl. Stir to coat in all the tasty flavours. Add the stock; canned tomato; salt and pepper.  Cook 15 minutes – Give it a good stir; let it come to a boil then lower the heat to medium high so it's simmering rapidly but not boiling like crazy. Cook for 15 minutes (no lid); stirring every 2 minutes or so at first then more regularly towards the end; so the base doesn't catch. Lower the heat a touch towards the end; if needed. How to tell it's done – Most of the liquid should be absorbed and the pasta should be just cooked (al dente); though still a little soupy (that's good; it gets absorbed quickly while serving). Stir in the basil. Serve – Transfer into a serving bowl or divide between bowls. Dollop the whipped ricotta on top then randomly smear (or let everyone do that themselves); it will get all melty. Dig in!
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-roast-easter-stuffed-lamb/, Roast hazelnuts – Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Roast the hazelnuts for 8 minutes. Cool; then roughly chop. Blitz the mushrooms in a food processor; scraping down the sides as needed; until the mushrooms are chopped into little 3mm/0.1" pieces. Duxelle – Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over high heat. Add eschalots; garlic and mushrooms. Cook; stirring regularly; for 5 minutes or until the liquid that comes out of the mushrooms mostly evaporates. Add spinach and cook until wilted. Cool – Transfer the filling into a bowl. Cool for 20 minutes then stir in remaining ingredients. Stuffing log – Pile the stuffing on a piece of cling wrap. Use your hands to roughly shape it into a 35cm / 13.5" long log. Tightly roll up with cling wrap. Place in the freezer for 3 hours (up to 3 days) until it is firm. (Note 7) Pound – Place the lamb shoulder fat-side down. Cover with plastic wrap (I use go between) or baking paper. Then use a rolling pin or meat mallet to pound the meat (hard!) into a 40 x 22cm rectangle (15.5 x 8.5"). Aim for even thickness ~1.75cm (2/3"). Trim and patch as needed to make your rectangle – see video; I cut & rearrange 2 large flappy bits that stick out. Roll – Sprinkle the surface of the lamb with half the salt and pepper. Unwrap the frozen stuffing log then roll it up tightly; finishing with the seam side down. Tie – Secure with kitchen twine tied every 2cm / 0.8". (See video for tips) Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan-forced). Season – Rub the lamb roll all over with the olive oil; then sprinkle with the remaining salt and pepper. Potatoes – Toss the potatoes with the salt; pepper and olive oil in a large roasting pan (not a baking tray). Put the lamb on top of the potato; on the diagonal if needed to fit. Short high temp roast – Roast for 30 minutes (renders some fat and gives the colour a head start). Slow roast – Turn the oven down to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan). Cook for 2 1/2 hours; or until the internal temperature is 98°C/208°F or the meat can be fairly easily teased apart using two fork (check in a discreet spot). Rest – Remove lamb and potato to a tray and loosely cover with foil while you make the gravy. Drippings – The roasting pan will have meat juices and fat. Tilt the pan so you can scoop off and discard all but 3 tablespoons of fat (the clear liquid that rises to the surface). Make sure you keep the dark brown juices in the pan. If you're short of fat; add butter. Heat fat – Put the pan directly on the stove over medium heat. Once the fat is hot; sprinkle the flour over and stir for 1 minute. Thicken – While stirring; slowly pour in the stock. Add soy sauce; then keep stirring as it bubbles gently until it thickens into a maple syrup consistency. Taste and add more salt and pepper if desired (I don't need more). Pour into a jug (strain; if needed). Cut the string off the lamb then slice into 2cm / 0.8" thick slices. Plate on a platter; surround with the potatoes. Serve with gravy; sprinkled with extra chopped pistachios if desired! (Shown in the video with sautéed green beans).
https://www.recipetineats.com/pikelets/, Whisk dry – Whisk the flour; baking powder; salt and sugar in a bowl. Add wet – Make a well in the centre. Add the egg; milk and vanilla; then whisk until it's almost lump free. The batter should be the consistency like thick honey – looser than tomato sauce; thicker than maple syrup. (Note 2) Melt 1 tsp butter in a non-stick pan over medium high heat (or medium; for strong stoves). Then most of the butter off with a paper towel so there are no visible drops of bubbles of butter (Note 3). Drop ~2 tbsp batter into the pan and coax into 7.5cm/3" rounds. An ice cream scoop with lever will be your friend here. I cook 4 at a time.  Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and once 4 or more of these bubbles pop (1 1/2 minutes); this means they are ready to flip. Flip with confidence! Then cook the other side for 1 minute or until golden. Keep cooking – Remove onto a plate. Cook the next batch (no need to add extra butter until 3rd batch). Serve warm with jam and cream; or butter!

Cool 20 min on tray; attack! Simmer to brown – Put the butter in a silver saucepan or small pan over medium high heat. Once melted; let it simmer (as in; bubbling) for 4 to 5 minutes; stirring every now and then; until it gets real foamy; you see little golden specks (wade through foam to see) and it smells nutty & extra buttery. Cool – Immediately pour into a heatproof bowl; including all those golden specks. Cool to room temperature (~45 minutes); cool enough so it won't melt the choc chips (Note 4) Whisk Dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Mix Wet – To the browned butter; add both sugars and mix with a wooden spoon. Add the egg; yolk and vanilla. Mix until smooth – it will look caramel. Finish dough – Add the Dry ingredients and mix until the flour is mostly incorporated. Add the choc chips and stir until the flour is fully incorporated. Make dough discs – Measure out 8 x 155g (5.3 oz/ 1/2 cup) portions of dough; roll into a ball then shape into a 3.75cm/1.5" thick round disc. Place in a very airtight container. (Note 5 for smaller cookies) Fridge 12 hours – Refrigerate for 12 hours; up to 48 hours (Note 6 for different chill times). Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (170°C fan-forced).

https://www.recipetineats.com/devilled-eggs/, Hard boil eggs; halve; blitz yolks with Filling ingredients except butter; then blitz in butter. Pipe (18 – 20 pieces); garnish; serve! Large pot – Bring a large pot with 15cm / 6 water to the boil. Lower eggs in gently using a spider or slotted spoon. Lower heat a tiny bit if needed to stop the eggs from jostling around so much they crack. Boil and swirl –  Boil eggs for 10 minutes. Swirl the water every minute for the first 6 minutes; using the handle of a wooden spoon. Give the water 4 or 5 fast stirs in one direction to make the water and eggs swirl in the water. The centrifugal force will make the yolks cook centred in the egg white (ie no thin broken egg white walls) (Note 4). Peel – Fill a sink with cold tap water. Remove eggs from the boiling water using a slotted spoon or spider. Leave for 5 minutes until cool enough to handle. Tap the base then peel under water (it's easier). Remove yolks – Cut eggs in half and remove the yolks using a teaspoon. Filling – Place the yolks and all filling ingredients EXCEPT butter in a small food processor (Note 5). Blitz until yolks are broken up. Add butter and blitz; scraping down the sides as needed; until the butter is blended through. The filling should be creamy (smear with back of spoon to check). Choose the best 18 to 20 egg white halves. (Note 6) Brush yolk crumbs off the cut surface. Pipe – Transfer filling into a piping bag fitted with a nozzle of your choice (I use a star). Fill so it's mounded – I do about the same amount as a whole yolk. Sprinkle with paprika and chives. Serve! (Best enjoyed at room temperature rather than fridge cold as the filling is creamier.)
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-red-duck-curry/, Slash duck skin; season. Cold pan; no oil; 10 min medium low (weigh down duck) until golden. Reserve 3 tbsp fat. Finish in oven 8 min (target 60°C/140°F; medium); rest. Sauté curry paste in duck fat with garlic and ginger; add stock; reduce by half; add coconut; fish sauce; sugar; lime leaves; simmer 2 min. Add beans; simmer 3 min; add lychees or pineapple; simmer 2 min. Slice duck; serve! Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Score – Sprinkle half the salt and pepper on the flesh of the duck. Turn. Use a sharp knife to make 5 or 6 diagonal scores on the skin of the breast. Don't pierce the flesh and don't cut all the way to the edge of the skin (Note 8). Pat the skin dry with paper towels; sprinkle with remaining salt and pepper. Cold pan; no oil – Don't turn the stove on yet. Use an oven-proof pan (any type). Place the duck skin side down in the cold pan; no oil required. Place another pan on top to lightly weigh the duck down (keeps skin flat). Cook 10 minutes – Turn the stove onto medium low. Cook for 10 minutes or until the skin is golden and crispy. Fat will melt out of the duck skin and it will cook in its own fat. (Note 8) Reserve duck fat – Pour off 2 to 3 tablespoons of the duck fat into the pan you will use to make the curry sauce. Oven 8 minutes – Once the skin is crispy; turn and cook the flesh side for 1 minute. Then transfer the pan to the oven for 8 minutes or until the internal temperature is 60°C/140°F (medium; Note 9) Rest – Transfer to a rack or plate and rest for 5 minutes until ready to assemble the curry. Sauté curry paste – Heat the duck fat (from step 6 above) on medium heat in a deep skillet. Cook the curry paste; garlic and ginger for 4 to 5 minutes. It will dry out and darken in colour; and substantially improves the flavour (especially store bought; but even homemade). Sauce – Add chicken stock; stir; then simmer rapidly to reduce by half (2 -3 minutes). Stir in coconut milk; hand-crushed kaffir lime leaves; sugar and fish sauce. Simmer gently on medium for 2 minutes. Add ins – Add the beans; simmer for 3 minutes until just cooked. Add the lychees or pineapple; simmer 1 minute. Taste and add a tad extra fish sauce if it needs salt. Spoon some sauce in to cover the base of a large deep platter or wide bowl. Slice duck breast; just shy of 5mm / 0.2" thick. Place on the sauce; fanning it out slightly to expose the pink flesh. Remaining sauce – Spoon the remaining sauce; lychees etc around the duck; avoiding the duck skin. Garnish with Thai basil leaves; coriander; chilli and lime wedges. Serve – Take to the table with flourish and serve with jasmine rice!

https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-goat-cheese-roasted-red-pepper-risoni-orzo/, Boil risoni – Bring a small pot or large saucepan of water to the boil. Add salt and cook risoni until just under al dente (ie still a bit firm inside) as it will cook more in the sauce. 8 minutes for me. Drain & rinse – Just before draining; scoop out 1/2 cup pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain; rinse briefly under the tap then leave the risoni in the colander while you finish the sauce. Sauté – Heat the oil in a large non stick skillet (30cm/12") over high heat. Add onion and cook for 2 minutes until starting to soften. Add garlic and capsicum strips. Cook for 2 minutes until the onion is softened. Simmer – Add tomato and olives. Bring to a simmer; lower heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes; stirring every now and then. Melt goat cheese – Add cooked risoni; salt; pepper and the pasta cooking water. Stir to combine. Add most of the goat's cheese (reserve some for garnish); stir so it melts. Basil & serve – Stir through basil or parsley just before serving. Divide between bowls. Crumble over reserved goat's cheese; sprinkle with extra basil. Dig in with a spoon!
https://www.recipetineats.com/popcorn-chicken/, Marinade chicken 1 hour+ in Buttermilk Marinade. Dribble then rub 3 tbsp marinade in breading to make small clumps. Dredge chicken; fry 2 minutes at 180C/350F. Cut chicken into small 1.25 cm / 1/2" cubes. Marinade – Whisk marinade in a bowl. Add chicken; stir to coat; then refrigerate for 1 hour (no longer than 24 hours). Breading mixture – Mix together Breading and all KFC Secret Herbs & Spices in a large bowl (larger surface area = coat more chicken in one go). Clump = crunchy! Drizzle 3 tablespoons of the Marinade into the flour mixture. Use your fingers to rub in so you get lots of small lumpy bits all throughout (this fries up into extra crunchy bits; secret trick!). Frying vessel (Note 5) – Large saucepan / small pot ~20cm/8" recommended for beginners. Large pot / deep skillet ~24cm/9.5" or larger recommended only for capable cooks. Use heavy based (not light and flimsy); for safety and heat retention.  Preheat oven to 50°C/125°F; to keep cooked chicken warm. Bread chicken – Pick up a handful of chicken from the marinade with your left hand; then scatter across surface of the flour mixture. Spoon flour over chicken then toss with the spoon to coat. Shake off excess (use right hand) – Separate the chicken pieces and press the clumpy flour onto the chicken pieces. Pick up a handful; shake excess flour off through fingers (no need to be thorough). Spread chicken on tray. Repeat with remaining chicken. Voila! No clumpy flour-batter-caked fingers! Separate and last minute coat (Note 6) – Just before frying; use your fingers to briefly re-toss the chicken you're about to cook in the residual flour on the tray (to freshen up the flour coating; as it sits around it sweats/gets wet); and make sure the chicken pieces are not stuck together. Line a tray with paper towels (for draining cooked chicken). Preheat oven to 50°C/125°F to keep cooked chicken warm. Heat oil – Add oil to your pot to a depth of 2.5 cm / 1". Heat it over medium high to  180°C/350°F (Note 7).  Fry 2 minutes – Pick up some chicken and put it in a spider with large holes (Note 8) and shake so excess flour falls through (or use hands to shake off excess flour then then transfer into a scoop to lower into oil). Carefully lower chicken into the oil. Fry for 2 – 2.5 minutes until golden; separating any that get stuck together around halfway through. Drain – Scoop out with a spider and spread on a paper towel lined tray Keep cooked chicken warm in the oven and cook remaining chicken. Serve chicken – in popcorn boxes; for extra fun factor! – with dipping sauce of choice (pictured; Honey Mustard).

Pour off juices into pasta; toss. Add 1/2 tsp salt into tomato; toss. Add into pasta with basil; parmesan. Finish with balsamic glaze and pine nuts. Enjoy! Dressing – Shake the ingredients in a jar (or whisk in a jug). Soft cooked pasta – Bring a large pot of water to the boil with the 2 teaspoons of salt. Cook the pasta per the packet time plus 2 minutes; until the pasta is overcooked and soft. (Note 5) Drain in a colander; then return the pasta into the same pot. Flavour the pasta – Give the dressing a good shake then pour 2/3 of it over the pasta. Stir (enjoy the smell!). Set aside to cool for 15 minutes and let the pasta absorb the dressing flavour. Bruschetta – Put chopped tomato and all watery juices into a bowl. Pour over remaining Dressing; gently toss. Set aside for 10 minutes or until the pasta is cool to let the flavours meld. Finishing (the order matters!) – Pour the juices accumulated in the tomato bowl into the pasta then toss to disperse. Add the salt into the tomato; gently toss; then add the tomato into the pasta. Add the basil; parmesan; gently toss. Serve – Pour into a big bowl and serve! If using extra finishes; drizzle with a swish of balsamic glaze (not too much; it's strong!) and sprinkle with pine nuts. Eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-cheesecake/, Blitz crumb. Press into 33 x 23 cm / 9 x 13" lined pan with paper overhang (important). Bloom gelatine in the water; re-melt. Whip cream. In separate bowl whip cream cheese + sugar; then vanilla; lemon; salt and gelatine. Fold in 1/4 cream; then remaining cream. Fill pan; fridge 12 hours; decorate! Line – Grease a 23 x 33 cm / 9 x 13" can VERY lightly with butter or spray with a plain oil (I use canola). Line with parchment/baking paper with lots of overhang on the long side to lift the cheesecake out once set (see photos).  Blitz – Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz until it becomes fine crumbs (~30 seconds). Add butter – Add the butter; cinnamon and salt. Blitz until it resembles wet sand (~ 10 second). It should stay together when pinched between your fingers. Press – Pour into the prepared pan. Spread then use your hand or something flat to press it in firmly (firmer = more stable base). Refrigerate until required. Bloom gelatine – Put the water in a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatine across the surface (don't dump it in one place. Whisk until dissolved then set aside for 3 minute or until it firms up like rubber. Melt – Microwave for 15 seconds on high or until it melts (do not let it boil). Cool for 5 minutes while you make the filling (make sure it's still liquid when you use it; if there's a skin on surface or walls; warm for 5 seconds to liquify). Whip cream – Put the cream in a bowl and whip it with an electric beater on high for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until firm peaks form (ie not softly whipped; we want good aeration!). Whip cream cheese – Put the cream cheese and sugar in a separate large bowl. Using the same beater (no need to clean); beat on high for 1 1/2 minutes just until it's soft and smooth. Add the vanilla; lemon and melted gelatine; then beat for 10 seconds on high to mix it through thoroughly. Don't beat excessively as we don't want too many air bubbles in the cheesecake (unsightly). Fold – Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold through using a rubber spatula or large spoon (don't mix aggressively; you'll knock all the air out of the cream!). Then fold in the rest of the cream. Refrigerate – Pour into the pan and smooth the surface. Refrigerate for 12 hours+ to set. Remove – Use the paper overhang to lift the cheesecake out of the pan and transfer it onto a serving platter. Then slide the paper out from underneath. Refrigerate until ready to decorate. Whip cream – Put the ingredients in a bowl and whip on high for 2 to 3 minutes until softly whipped. (Use an electric beater or stand mixer fitted with a whisk. Also; see Note 6 for stabilising to assemble ahead). Decorate – Spread the cream in big swirls across the surface of the cake. Pile on the berries and cherries; tuck in the orange slices and rosemary. Dust with icing sugar then cut into slices and serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-sweet-chilli-beef-bowls/, Mix each sauce. Toast cashews; sauté onion + garlic 1 min; then cook beef.

Attack! Mix dry – Mix the flour; baking soda and salt in a bowl; set aside. Barely melt butter – Using a heatproof bowl; microwave the butter for 30 seconds on high until mostly but not fully melted; then stir with a rubber spatula to finish melting it so it's "milky" rather than clear yellow oil (Note 5). Wet mixture – Add the sugar; vanilla and honey; stir until combined. Add the egg and stir until combined; it should look like caramel. Chill dough 1 1/2 hours – Add the flour mixture and stir until combined. The mixture should be slightly warm and too soft to roll into balls. Cover and refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours to cool and firm up enough to roll into a log. Line a small tray with baking paper / parchment paper. Dollop Nutella on tray and spread to ~8mm/ 1/3"thick rounds. Freeze for 1 hour until firm enough to pick up. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Lightly grease 2 trays then line with paper. Cut dough – Scrape dough out and shape/roll into a ~18cm / 7" log. Cut into 10 equal pieces. Stuff – Flatten cookie dough; press in frozen Nutella; bundle dough up around it to enclose and seal. Flip upside down so the smooth side is facing up. Shape into ~1.5cm/ 3/5" thick rounds; press choc chips into the surface and sides. Repeat to make 10 cookies; 5 on each tray; 8cm/3" apart to allow for spreading (Note 6 working tips).

Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F (170°C fan-forced). Grease and line a 22 x 12 x 7 cm loaf pan with paper (8.7 x 4.7 x 2.75"; Note 6). Toss the raspberries with the flour. If using frozen; put the bowl in the freezer (so they don't thaw). Wet ingredients – Put the butter in a heatproof bowl and microwave until melted. Cool for a minute then whisk in the sugar. Next; add the yogurt; eggs; vanilla and lemon. Whisk until combined. Dry ingredients – Sprinkle the dry ingredients across the surface; then mix it in using a rubber spatula. Stop mixing as soon as the flour is incorporated – some lumps in the batter is fine. (Over mixing = tough loaf) Raspberries – Working fast; add the white chocolate and the raspberries (including any residual flour in the bowl); then mix briefly just to disperse the raspberries. (Fresh raspberries – careful not to squish them. Frozen – work fast; else the batter chills and thickens = takes longer to bake). Batter is pretty thick. Fill pan – Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Roughly level the surface (spreads and levels in the oven). Press Extra Raspberries into the surface; if using. Bake 40 minutes. Cover loosely with foil then bake for a further 35 minutes for fresh raspberries; 40 minutes for frozen. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out without raw batter on it. Cool 5 minutes in the pan; then transfer onto a rack. Full cool before glazing. Mix Glaze ingredients in a bowl until smooth. Glaze – Put the rack on a tray or plate to catch glaze drips. Drizzle glaze all over the cake. Scrape up glaze from the plate and glaze again. Serve – Leave for 20 minutes to let a crust form on the glaze before cutting thick slices to serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-cajun-beef-pasta/, Heat the oil in a large heavy based pot with a lid over high heat. Cook vegetables – Cook the onion and garlic for 2 minutes. Add the beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; until you no longer see red meat. Add the carrot and zucchini; cook for 2 minutes until the water they release mostly evaporates. Add the capsicum and cook for 2 minutes. Spices – Add the tomato paste and Cajun Spices. Cook for 1 minute. Pasta sauce – Add the canned tomato; water (I swill the cans clean); stock and beans. Mix and bring to a simmer. Add the pasta; stir; let it come back up to the simmer. Put the lid on and lower the heat slightly to medium so the liquid is simmering (not bubbling madly). Cook for 15 minutes; stirring every few minutes so the base doesn't catch. The pasta should be a bit firmer than you want in the middle; and still a bit soupy which is good! Liquid gets absorbed in the next step. Melt cheese – Give it a stir; smooth the surface; sprinkle with cheese. Put the lid on then turn the stove off (leave the pot on the stove). Leave for 3 minutes so the residual heat melts the cheese and the pasta finishes cooking. Serve – Remove from the stove; sprinkle with green onion if desired; then serve immediately while saucy and the cheese is gooey!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pan-fried-halloumi-with-honey-and-thyme/, Cut into 1 – 1.25cm / 0.4 – 0.5″ slices; pat dry. Pan fry in the oil on medium high until golden; serve on pre-warmed plate; with optional finishes. Cut halloumi into 1-1.25 cm thick slices (0.4 – 0.5") (see Note 3). Place the slices on a paper towel and pat the surface dry. Warm a serving plate. (Note 4) Heat the oil in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Fry – Carefully place the halloumi in the pan (I use my hands). Cook for 1 1/2 minutes or until the underside is golden. Shuffle if needed so they cook evenly. Turn gently (I use a spatula + butter knife to guide) and cook the other side for 1 – 1/2 minutes until golden. Transfer onto the serving plate. Optional finishes – Working quickly; drizzle with honey; sprinkle with thyme and chilli flakes. I do full honey coverage for some slices; and for others just a drizzle.  Serve immediately; quick; before the halloumi goes squeaky! 🙂 Though actually; the squeak doesn’t bother me but it's at its prime straight out of the pan when the surface is still crisp and the inside is soft. (Note: Honey on the plate is ideal for bread mopping)
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-and-leek-pie/, Sear surface of chicken in half butter; remove. Cook bacon 1 minute; then leek; celery and garlic 5 minutes. Deglaze with wine; melt remaining butter; then cook flour 1 minute. Add stock; then remaining Filling ingredients. Add chicken; thicken sauce (~5 minutes). Cool filling 1 hour; assemble pie with double layer puff on rim; brush lid with yolk; bake 45 minutes 200°C/375°F (180°C fan). Trim the reedy dark green ends and root off; then cut in half. Cut each piece in half lengthways. Remove the outer 5 to 6 layers (keep them together); lay them flat; cut in half lengthways then into 1.8cm / 3/4" squares. Cut the inner core into 2cm / 0.8" pieces. Chicken – Melt half the butter in a large pan over high heat. Add the chicken; salt and pepper. Cook until the surface changes from pink to white (inside still raw); then remove into a bowl using a slotted spoon. Leave residual butter and chicken juices in the pan. Sauté – In the same pan; cook the bacon for 1 minute. Add the leek; celery and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes until the celery is softened. Don't let the leek brown – lower the heat if needed. Deglaze – Add the wine and simmer rapidly on high heat; stirring; until it is mostly evaporated. Roux – Lower the heat to medium. Add the remaining butter. Once it melts; sprinkle the flour across the surface (don't dump in one place) and stir for 1 minute. Creamy sauce – While stirring; slowly pour the stock in. The mixture will thicken into a thick sauce once combined. Then add the mustard; cream; thyme; bay leaves; salt and pepper. Stir to combine; then add the chicken including all the juices accumulated in the bowl. Simmer – Increase the heat; stir to combine. Once it comes to a simmer; reduce the heat to medium high. Simmer for 5 minutes; stirring regularly; or until the sauce is a thick creamy consistency you want in the finished pie (ie sauce thickness now = thickness in the baked pie; see Note 7). Cool – Remove the pan from the stove and cool for 1 hour. (You can also store in fridge for 3 – 4 days). Preheat the oven to 200°C/375°F (180°C fan-forced). Use a 1.5 litre / 1.5 quart baking pan (Note 9) or 4 to 5 x ~350ml / 12 oz ramekins. Connect puff pastry sheets (if needed) – Semi-thaw the puff pastry (Note 6). Brush the edge of one sheet with egg white; then overlap 0.5cm / 0.2" with the other sheet to connect them. Use the back of a spoon to "smear" the pastry to hide the seam and firmly connect. Cut out the pie lid (I use the dish as a cutting guide). Optional strips for extra puffy edges (Note 8): Cut strips using the residual pastry to line the rim of the dish (if your dish has a thick rim; like mine) and place on the rim of the dish. Fill the pie dish with the cooled filling and smooth the surface. Brush the pastry strips on the rim with egg white (if not using strips; don't do this step) then cover with the puff pastry lid. Brush the lid with egg yolk. Cut a small X in the middle. Bake 45 minutes or until the surface is a deep golden brown. Rest 5 minutes then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cinnamon-breakfast-muffins/, Toast walnuts 190°C/375°F (170°C fan) 8 minutes. Cool; roughly chop. Whisk dry; whisk wet in separate bowl. Add wet into dry with add-ins; mix; fill oil-sprayed muffin tin. Bake 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F (170°C fan-forced). Toast walnuts – Put the walnuts on a tray and toast for 8 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the tray then roughly chop into 5mm / 0.2" pieces. Spray a 12 hole standard muffin tin with oil; or line with muffin cases. Batter – Whisk the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk the wet ingredients until combined in a separate bowl. Pour the wet ingredients and all the add-ins into the Dry Ingredients bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon just until you can no longer see flour; then stop mixing (over-mixed batter = tough muffs!). Divide the mixture between the holes – they will mound above the rim! (See photos in post). A lever ice cream scoop is super useful here. And don't worry; they won't overflow; they rise and dome. Bake for 25 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes in the muffin tin; then transfer onto a cooling rack and cool for at least another 5 minutes before grabbing on. Slathering with softened salted butter is encouraged!
https://www.recipetineats.com/nagi-big-easy-pasta-salad/, Cook pasta until soft; toss with 2/3 Dressing; cool. Toss with everything else except basil; then add basil. Serve! Dressing – Shake the Dressing ingredients in a large jar. It should be sharp; the flavour mellows once tossed. Cook pasta until soft – Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook the pasta until it is very soft; about 2 – 3 minutes longer than the time on the packet but taste to check because packet directions have been known to lie! Pasta firms up when it's cold (nobody likes hard; cold pasta!); so cook the pasta until extra soft. Flavour soak – Drain the pasta very well; shaking off excess water. Transfer into a large bowl. Give the Dressing a good shake then pour over about two-thirds. Toss well; then leave the pasta to soak up the dressing as it cools (~40 minutes). Toss – Add the tomato; cucumber; feta and olives. Pour over the remaining Dressing. Toss well. Add basil; toss again. Serve – Tumble into big serving bowl. Dig in!
https://www.recipetineats.com/hot-buttered-corn-rice/, Pot size – Use a small pot or large saucepan about 20-22 cm/8-9". (Note 3) Sauté – Melt half the butter in a pot over high heat. Add the garlic and stir for 15 seconds. Add the corn and half the salt. Stir for 2 minutes. Bring to simmer – Add the rice and stir for 30 seconds. Add the stock and remaining salt; and pepper. Stir; bring to a simmer (make sure the whole surface is bubbling/ripplling); then put the lid on and turn the heat down to medium low (or low; if your stove is strong). (Note 4) Cook for 12 minutes (no peeking; no stirring!). The liquid should be absorbed by now – tilt the pot and take a quick peek to check. Rest 10 minutes – Remove the pot from the stove and let it rest for 10 minutes with the lid on. This step is key; do not skip it! (Note 5) Toss – Lift the lid; add the remaining butter; fluff the rice to melt the butter through. Add green onion and toss through. Tumble into serving bowl. Serve hot!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-crackers/, Mix dry ingredients; make well; stir in wet. Divide in half; roll out 3mm / 1/8" thick. Transfer to paper; sprinkle with sesame and flakes; roll to 2mm / 1/12". Cut into 5cm / 2" pieces; transfer to tray; spray with oil. Bake 12 min; rearrange to colour evenly; bake 8 to 10 min until light golden.  Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan-forced). Mix the flour; sesame and salt in a bowl using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Make a well in the centre then add the water and oil. Using the handle of the spatula to mix until the flour is incorporated. Roll out #1 Sprinkle the counter lightly with flour. Scrape the dough out then knead a few times to bring it together into a ball. Cut in half. Roll one piece out to 3mm / 1/8" thin oval shape. (Note 3) Sprinkle – Place a sheet of baking paper (parchment) on a cutting board. Transfer the rolled out dough onto the paper. Sprinkle with half the sesame and half the salt flakes. Roll out even thinner on the paper to 2mm / 1/12" (thinner = crispier).  Cut into 5cm / 2" squares using a pizza cutter or knife (Note 4). You'll have smaller pieces on the edge and corners; that's fine. Leave the pieces as is; don't try to move them (so thin; it's too hard!). Slide the paper onto a tray. Repeat with the other piece of dough. Bake – Spray with oil. Bake both trays together for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven. Re-arrange to move the more golden pieces on the outer rim of the tray to the centre (so they cook evenly). Bake for a further 8 to 10 minutes or until all the pieces are light golden (white = not crispy!). Serving – Remove from the oven and leave the crackers to cool on the tray (~20 minutes). Make dip or prepare cheese platter worthy of your homemade crackers. Then attack!
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-kofta-kebabs/, Sauce – Mix the ingredients in a bowl and set aside to let the flavours meld while you make the kofta kebabs. Kofta kebabs – Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well with your hands until the spices are mixed through. Divide into 8; shape into 13cm/5″ logs. Thread onto skewers then flatten slightly to about 1.25cm / 0.5″ thick (Note 5). Cook – Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook half the koftas for 2 minutes on each side until golden; then about 30 seconds on each short edge (just for a bit of colour). Reduce the heat if they’re browning too fast. Transfer to a serving plate; loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Cook the remaining koftas. (Scrape out loose burnt bits; if any. You shouldn’t need extra oil.) Serve and assemble! Pile the lettuce; tomato and onion on the plate and put the sauce in a bowl. To assemble; take a warm pita bread and smear some sauce down the middle. Top with lettuce and 1 or 2 koftas (removed from the skewers); tuck tomato down the side and sprinkle with onion. Fold and EAT!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pistachio-cake/, Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160° fan-forced). Grease and line a 20 cm / 8" round cake pan with baking paper (parchment paper). Toast – Spread the pistachios on a tray. Bake for 12 minutes; shaking once halfway; or until the pistachios smell nutty and are crisp (eat to check!). Fully cool on the tray (~15 minutes). Blitz – Measure out 3/4 cup pistachios (save the rest for decorating). Blitz into a powder using pulses; taking care not to turn it into a paste. I use a NutriBullet (2 x 2 sec bursts). Spice grinder or small food processor would also work. Some larger pistachio bits are fine; but aim for 98% powder. (Note 6) Break up clumps – Put the pistachio powder in a large bowl with the flour. Briefly whisk to combine then use your fingers to rub pistachio powder clumps into a powder. No need to be meticulous here; just get the larger ones. Dry – Add the remaining Dry ingredients then whisk to combine. Wet – Put all the Wet ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk until combined. Combine wet & dry – Pour the Wet into the Dry ingredients bowl. Use a rubber spatula to mix until the flour is almost mixed in. Colour it! Add the food colouring. Then finish mixing the batter until mostly lump free (small lumps will dissolve when baked). Scrape the batter into the pan and spread out it out (no need to be meticulous; the surface will smooth out in the oven). Bake for 40 minutes; turning the pan at 30 minutes so the surface browns evenly; or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out without batter on it. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes; then turn out onto a cooling rack and cool completely. (~1 hour) Chop the reserved pistachios (mix of finely chopped and larger chunks). Spread the cake with the Cream Cheese Whip (steps below). Sprinkle with chopped pistachios. Cut and eat! Beat the cream cheese for a good 2 minutes on medium high until it's really light and creamy; scraping down the sides as needed. Do not shortcut this step; else you may end up with cream cheese lumps! Whip – Add the remaining ingredients then beat until the cream is softly whipped and spreadable; about 1 minute on medium high.
https://www.recipetineats.com/hokkien-noodles/, Marinate chicken with 1 1/2 tbsp Sauce. Cook chicken 1 min; add garlic and white part of green onion; cook 1 min. Add capsicum & cabbage; cook 2 min. Add green part of green onion; noodles; sauce; toss 2 min. Serve! Sauce – Mix the sauce in a small bowl. Briefly marinate chicken – Toss the chicken with 1 1/2 tbsp of the Sauce. Marinate for 10 minutes while you prepare the noodles and vegetables. Rinse noodles – Prepare the noodles per the packet directions (soak in boiling water or briefly boil). Drain in a colander then rinse briefly under tap water (Note 8) Sear chicken – Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat until very hot (mine is 30cm/12"; Note 9 re: wok). Add the chicken and toss for 1 minute. Add the garlic and white part of the green onion; then toss for another 1 minute or until the surface of the chicken is sealed (but still a bit raw inside) Cook veg & noodles – Add the capsicum and cabbage. Toss for 2 minutes until the cabbage is mostly wilted. Add the green part of the green onions; noodles and sauce. Toss for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until the noodles are stained a lovely mahogany colour. Serve immediately; sprinkled with sesame seeds and green onion if desired!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheesymite-scrolls/, Mix dry ingredients; add milk; knead 5 min. Rise until doubled (1.5 hours). Punch; roll out to 48 x 28 cm / 11 x 19” rectangle. Spread with butter; Vegemite then 300g cheese. Roll; cut into 12; put in lined pan; rise 30% (30 min). Top with remaining cheese. Bake 25 minutes at 180°C/350°F (160°C fan); rotate; bake 10 minutes 200°C/375°F (180°C fan) – keep an eye on it. Cool 10 min; eat! Check yeast – If your yeast is old or you weren't storing it in the fridge; check it's still good; see Note 6. Make dough – Put the flour; yeast; sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Briefly mix to combine. Add the milk then mix on low until you no longer see flour. Then beat; starting on low then increasing to medium partway through; for 5 minutes until the dough is smooth (see video for before/after visuals). (Note 8) Rise #1 – Shape the dough into a ball then put it back in the bowl. Cover with cling wrap. Let it rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until it doubles in size (see steps in post for more guidance). Roll out – Punch the dough to deflate in the bowl. Lightly flour a work surface; turn the dough out then use your hands to roughly shape it into a rectangle. Then roll out into a 48 x 28 cm / 11 x 19”rectangle using a rolling pin. Spread the dough with butter then with Vegemite. Sprinkle the whole area evenly with 3 cups (300g) of the cheese. Cut – Roll up into a log then cut into 12 even pieces. Pre-heat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Lightly grease a 23 x 33cm / 9 x 13″ pan with butter. Then line with baking paper with overhang (so you can lift the slab out later). Rise #2 – Place the scrolls into the pan; evenly spaced apart. Spray a piece of cling wrap lightly with oil then cover the pan. Let the scrolls rise in a warm place for 30 minutes or until they expand/rise by about 30-50%. Bake – Top the scrolls with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25 minutes. Then rotate the pan and bake for a further 10 minutes at 200°C/375°F (180°C fan-forced) or until the cheese on the surface of the scrolls around the edge of the pan are light golden. Rest – Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Use the paper overhang to lift the slab onto a cooling rack then cool for a further 5 minutes. Peel the scrolls apart then devour! Best eaten warm. 20 seconds in the microwave!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-frozen-pea-fritters/, Mix the Batter ingredients. Stir in the Add-ins. Scoop; flatten; cook 1 1/2 minutes each side. Eat! Lemon Yogurt Dipping Sauce – Mix the ingredients together in a bowl and set aside while you cook the fritters to let the flavours meld. Fritter batter – Mix the Batter ingredients until combined. Add the Add-ins; then mix until the batter coats all the peas. It will look like waaaay too much peas for batter; but have faith! The batter will set as it cooks. Measure & flatten – Heat enough oil to cover the base of a pan on medium high (~2 1/2 tbsp). Pack a 3 tbsp cookie scoop (#20) or 1/4 cup measure firmly with the mixture. Place mound in the pan; then flatten to 1.25 / 0.5" thick. Repeat to to fill the pan (I do 4 – 5 at a time) Cook – Cook for 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is golden; then turn and cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes until golden and crispy. Transfer onto a paper towel lined tray. Repeat with remaining batter to make 9 -10 in total. Serve with Lemon Yogurt Dipping Sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/jam-drops-thumbprint-cookies/, Cream butter and sugar. Beat in vanilla; egg and salt; then beat in flour. Roll 3cm/1.2" balls (#60 cookie scoop); flatten; indent; fill. Bake 14 minutes 180°C/350°F (160°C fan); cool on tray. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Line 2 trays with baking paper/parchment paper. Cream butter and sugar – Beat the butter and sugar until creamy – about 1 1/2 minutes on medium speed using an electric beater or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Crumbly dough – Add the vanilla; egg and salt; then beat for ~20 seconds until incorporated. Add the flour and salt; then beat until you cannot see white flour. The mixture will be crumbly. Form cookies – Measure out 1 tablespoon of mixture; very tightly packed (#60 cookie scoop). Tap out onto your hand; scrunch in your first to press into a dough then roll into a smooth ball (3cm/1.2"). Flatten into a 1.25cm / 0.5" thick disc then use your thumb to make an indent. (This method avoids cracks; see Note 3). Fill – Place cookie on the tray; and repeat to make 25 – 28 cookies; leaving 3.5cm / 1.5" between each. Fill the indent with slightly heaped 1/2 teaspoon jam (Note 4). Bake for 14 minutes (both trays at the same time); or until the edges are light golden and the surface is pale golden. Rotate and switch the tray shelves at the 10 minute mark; so they cook evenly. Cool fully on the tray (the base will finish cooking). Then grab and devour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-chicken-noodle-soup/, Croutons – Preheat the oven to 180°C/3450°F (160°C fan-forced). Toss the bread  with the oil and salt. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes; tossing halfway; until golden and fully crisp (some breads take longer eg sourdough). Cool on the tray; set aside. Season chicken – Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with the salt and pepper. Crispy bacon – Place the bacon in a single layer in an un-heated; large pot. Turn the heat onto medium high then cook the bacon until golden on both sides (~2-3 minutes first side; 1 1/2 minutes second side). (Note 2). Remove bacon (leave fat in pot); drain on paper towels. It will crisp as it cools. Finely chop; set aside for garnish. Cook chicken – Using the same pot; still hot; cook the chicken in the tasty bacon fat for 1 1/2 minutes on each side until light golden. Remove onto a plate. Once cool enough to handle; chop into small 8 mm / 1/3" cubes. Broth – Lower heat to medium high. In the same pot; melt the butter. Add the onion; garlic; celery; carrot; thyme sprigs. Cook 5 minutes until the carrot is softened; stirring regularly (don’t let the onion brown). Add flour and stir for 1 minute. While stirring; slowly pour the milk in. Once the flour is dissolved; add the stock; water and salt; then stir. Simmer – Turn the heat up to high and bring to a simmer; then lower the heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes; stirring every now and then. (The soup will seem thin; it thickens as the pasta cooks. Trust!) Pasta – Turn the heat back up to high. Add the pasta and corn. Cook for 5 minutes or until pasta is soft; adding the peas and chicken (including any juices pooled) for the last 2 minutes of cook time. Serve – Ladle into bowls; sprinkle with bacon; croutons and a pinch of parsley. Eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-edamame/, Spicy garlic sauce – Heat the oil in a small pan over medium low heat. Cook the garlic until very light golden; then add everything else. Stir; then simmer on low for 1 minute. Remove from stove. Edamame – Bring a large pot of water to the boil and add the salt. Put the frozen edamame in the water. Bring it back up to the boil then cook for 2 minutes (Note 5 – ignore the packet times; they always say too long!). Drain well; shaking off excess water. Toss – Transfer edamame into a bowl; pour over sauce; toss. Transfer into a serving bowl – scrape out every drop of sauce! Serve warm or at room temperature. To eat; pick up a sauce-slathered pod. Bite the pod so the soybeans pop out into your mouth; and suck all the sauce off the skin. Discard the skin; repeat and repeat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-tataki/, Prep – Preheat the oven to 130°C / 275°F (all oven types). Rub the beef with the oil and sprinkle with salt. Place on a rack set on a tray. Roast for 18 – 20 minutes or until the internal temperature in the middle is 41°C / 105°F (check first at 15 minutes; Note 9). Sear – Heat a cast iron skillet on high heat until it is smoking. Sear each side of the beef for just 10 seconds; no longer (I do 4 sides). Cool – Transfer the beef onto a rack on a tray. Cool for 30 minutes on the counter then refrigerate uncovered for 2 hours.  Thinly slice – When ready to serve; slice it as thinly as you can without tearing the beef; aiming for 3mm / 1/16" but up to 5mm / 1/8" thick is fine. (Note 10 for tips) Place the sake and mini in a tiny saucepan on low heat. Bring to a simmer; then simmer for 1 minute. Pour into a bowl; let it cool.  Then stir in remaining dressing ingredients. Put the garlic and oil in a tiny saucepan on low heat. Simmer for 5 minutes; stirring a few times; until the garlic is light golden. Cool for 15 minutes then strain (reserve crispy garlic for another use) Plate up – Lay the beef slices on a plate; overlapping slightly. Drizzle with 3-4 tbsp of the Dressing; then 1 1/2 tbsp of the garlic oil. Pile the crispy potato in a heap in the middle; sprinkle with green onion. (Or use the easy steak garnish options above instead).  To eat – Serve straight away. Make sure you get some crispy potato in every bite; and squidge the beef around in the tasty sauce. Cook – Rub the steak with the oil then sprinkle with the salt. Heat a cast iron skillet on high heat until it is smoking. Cook the steak to rare (1 1/2 – 2 minutes on each side; but it will depend on thickness of steak); or to your taste (Note 11 for doneness). Cool & thinly slice steak per beef tenderloin steps above. Assemble – Place the slices in a line; slightly overlapping. Drizzle over Dressing and oil (or alternative Sauce of choice). Sprinkle crispy fried shallots down the centre then green onion. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-potato-straws-pommes-paille/, Shred – Finely julienne the potato using a julienne mandoline; 2-4 mm / 1/16 – 1/8" thick. (Note 2) Rinse – Place potato in a bowl of water and rinse; changing the water as needed; until the water is clear. Drain in a colander. (Potato can be kept in water overnight in the fridge). Dry – Spread on tea towels then pat dry. If time permits; spread out and air dry for 1 hour+. (Drier potato = less oil bubbling + crispier fries). Heat the oil in a saucepan over high heat to 180°C/350°F; ensuring there is 10 cm/4" clearance above the oil surface (the oil bubbles up). Add potato into oil – SLOWLY scatter potato across the surface of the oil (don't dump in once place). ⚠️The oil will bubble up to ~7cm/3"; so add potato slowly; and you can pause until the bubbles subside before adding more. (Note 3 for cooking tips) Fry for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes; using chopsticks (or similar) to stir once or twice. Once light golden and crisp; scoop out and drain on paper towels. (It goes more golden as it drains). Repeat with remaining potato. Season – Carefully slide the fries into a bowl. Sprinkle with salt and gently toss. Serve immediately while warm; or cool.  Serve in bowls for munching; as a garnish like for Beef Tataki or serve a mound alongside a juicy steak or other protein (see in post for more ideas).
https://www.recipetineats.com/blondies/, Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Grease a 20 cm/8" square pan with butter and line with baking paper (parchment paper). Toast walnuts (Note 3) – Spread the walnuts on a tray and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. Browned butter (don't skip this step): Place the butter in a silver saucepan (not black) over medium high heat. Once melted; lower the heat to medium so it's simmer gently. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes; stirring every now and then (it will go foamy); until it smells nutty and you see little golden specks in the butter. Immediately pour the butter and all the golden bits into a bowl. Batter: Add the sugar into the hot butter and mix to combine using a wooden spoon. Leave to cool for 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla; mix until combined. Add the flour and salt; and mix to combine. It will be very thick; almost like roll-able cookie dough. Add the chocolate chips and walnuts and mix through. Bake: Scrape into the prepared pan; spread and smooth the surface (I use my hands). Bake for 25 minutes or until the edges are lightly tinged with gold and the surface has a paper thin "crackly" layer. Rest in the pan for 10 minutes before lifting onto a cutting board. Cool for at least another 10 minutes (else it's still a bit too soft and smeary); sprinkle with salt flakes (if using). Cut into 16 squares or 9 giant squares; then devour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/mediterranean-tuna-salad-with-creamy-feta-dressing/, Dressing – Put all the ingredients EXCEPT the water in a jug just large enough to fit the head of a stick blender. Blitz until smooth. Add water 1 tsp at a time until it's a thick drizzle-able consistency (don't dilute flavour too much). Then taste and add more salt if needed (feta saltiness varies by brand). Salad – Place all the salad ingredients EXCEPT the feta and tuna in a large bowl. Pour over the dressing; toss. Crumble feta in; toss (it will smear – we like!). Add the tuna and gently toss; trying to keep some chunks rather than it all crumbling into tiny pieces. Taste and add more lemon if desired (I enjoy this on the tart side – tuna can take it!). Serve in bowls with spoons for digging in! Tuck warm pita pockets on the side; or use the tuna salad to stuff inside the pita (it's sooooo good!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-oven-baked-quesadillas/, Filling – Heat the oil in a non stick pan over high heat. Add the beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; until the red colour is mostly gone. Add the Taco Seasoning and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the beans and corn; then add the water and stir. The filling should be juicy (not dry) but not watery (compromises crispiness!). Remove into a bowl and cool for at least 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan-forced). Grease a metal tray with 1 teaspoon of olive oil (I use my hand). Assemble quesadillas – Spread the filling on one side of the quesadilla. Top with cheese; fold to cover. Place on tray; repeat with remaining quesadillas. Drizzle the top of each with 1/2 tsp olive oil then spread using your hands (top and sides; not underside). Press the quesadilla down to flatten the surface. Bake for 8 minutes. Flip the quesadillas; bake for 5 minutes; flip again then bake for a further 2 minutes or until crispy. (Sometimes I spritz with oil to give it a helping hand) Serve – Cut each into half and serve immediately with dipping sauce/toppings of choice.
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-ricotta-gnocchi-with-creamy-mushroom-sauce/, Mix – Put all the gnocchi ingredients in a bowl except the flour. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to mix until combined (smear up the wall if needed; to help cream the ricotta). Add flour – Add 3/4 cup of flour and mix until just combined so it is a very sticky dough that will hold its shape in a mound; but is not runny like a muffin batter (see video for consistency). Stickier dough = softer gnocchi! Use the remaining flour; 1 tbsp at a time; if needed; but try to stick with 3/4 cup. You can always add more flour in the next step. (Note 3) Form disc – Sprinkle a work surface with flour then scrape the dough out onto it. Sprinkle the top lightly with flour then use your hands to give the dough a light knead to bring it into a ball then pat it into a disc about 2.5cm/1" thick. Cut it into 8 wedges; using a knife or dough scraper dusted with flour as needed between each cut Roll and cut – Roll each piece into a log 25cm/10" long; about 1.25cm / 1/2" wide. Cut into 1.5 cm / 3/5" pieces (Can freeze at this point – Note 4) Cook mushrooms – Melt the butter in a large pan over high heat. Add the onion; garlic and thyme sprigs. Cook for 1 minute. Add mushrooms; salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms is softened. Sauce – Add the wine and simmer rapidly for 1 to 2 minutes; stirring to scrape the base of the pan; until mostly evaporated. Add the stock/broth and cream; then stir.  Simmer – Bring to a simmer then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer gently for 5 minutes until thickened. (It's ok if it seems a bit thin; the starch from gnocchi will thicken it quickly; have faith!). Cook gnocchi – Bring a large pot of water to the boil with 2 teaspoons of salt. Tumble the gnocchi in and cook for around 2 1/2 minutes; or until the gnocchi is floating on the surface for around 30 seconds; no longer (else they overcook!) Sauce it – Use a spider or large slotted spoon to scoop the gnocchi out of the water and straight into the sauce (excess water drips in the sauce are good!). Turn the heat up to medium and toss gently for 1 minute or until the sauce thickens and coats the gnocchi. If the sauce gets too thick; add a splash of the gnocchi cooking water. Serve immediately; garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-cacciatore-italian-chicken-stew/, Season – Spread the chicken out on a tray. Sprinkle both sides with the salt and pepper. Brown skin – Heat the oil over high heat in a large; deep; heavy based pan; preferably one with a lid (Note 4). Place the chicken thighs in the pan; skin side down; and cook until the skin is golden brown; around 6 minutes. Turn and cook the flesh side for just 1 minute; then remove the chicken onto the same tray. Then add the drumsticks and brown each side as best you can; about 1 1/2 minutes on each side (the shape makes it awkward). Remove onto the tray. Onion – Pour off and discard all but about 2 tablespoons of fat. Turn the heat down to medium and let the pan cool slightly. Add the onion; rosemary leaves; bay leaves and dried oregano. Cook for 3 minutes until the onion is starting to soften. Garlic and anchovies – Clear a space in the middle of the pan. Add the anchovies and garlic; cooking; mashing up the anchovies; until the garlic is light golden; then stir it into the onion. Vegetables & tomato paste – Turn the heat back up to high. Add the mushroom and capsicum. Stir until softened – about 5 minutes (the mushrooms will go watery then the water will evaporate). Add the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes to cook out the sour flavour – do not shortcut this. Sauce – Add the wine. Stir; bring to simmer then allow to reduce by around 75%. Add the stock; canned tomato; salt and pepper. Stir; bring to a simmer. Simmer – Then carefully place the chicken into the sauce (skin side up) and pour any juices on the tray in as well. When the liquid returns to a simmer; cover; reduce the heat to medium then simmer energetically for 20 minutes. Remove lid; add olives; simmer for a further 10 minutes (no lid). This will reduce and thicken the sauce. Serve –  Serve the chicken with plenty of sauce over mashed potato or polenta; sprinkled with parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-peanut-butter-cake/, Preheat oven to 180C°/350°F (160°C fan).  Grease a 23 x 33cm / 9 x 13" metal cake pan with butter. Then line with paper with overhang; to make it easier to lift out. (For round pans; see Note 4). Dry ingredients – Sift flour; cocoa; baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl. Add Sugar and salt. Whisk briefly to combine. Wet ingredients – Add eggs; milk; oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free – about 30 seconds. Boiling water – Add the coffee powder then the boiling water. Whisk to incorporate. The batter is VERY thin (see video). Pour batter into the cake pan. Bake for 45 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes; then fully cool on a wire rack before frosting (~2 hours). Beat butter for 3 minutes on high until soft and fluffy; using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or handheld beater.  Icing sugar – Add icing sugar in 3 lots. Beat it in; starting on low speed then increasing the speed (to avoid a snow storm). Once incorporated; add more icing sugar and repeat. Beat 3 minutes – Once the icing sugar has all been added; added the peanut butter; salt and milk. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes to make it really nice and fluffy. Ready to use!

Preheat oven to 120°C/250°F (both fan and standard ovens) (Note 7). Butter – Put beef back in cooled skillet. Slather 3/4 of the butter onto the beef – top and sides (not underside). Roast 40 – 50 minutes – Roast for 15 minutes. Remove; slather remaining butter onto the top and sides. Roast for a further 25 – 35 minutes or until the internal temperature is 53°C/127°F for medium rare (Note 8 for other levels of doneness).  Rest & serve – Remove beef from the skillet onto a cutting board and rest for 10 minutes. The internal temperature will rise 56-58°C / 133-136°F (this is medium rare). Slice thickly and serve with Creamy Mushroom Sauce! Roasting juices – Pour all juices in skillet into a bowl or jug. The fat will rise to the surface. Pour off 1/4 cup (60ml) of the fat back into the skillet (reserve the rest for later). Cook mushrooms – Turn the stove onto high. Once the butter is hot; add mushrooms and cook until they start to sweat. Then add thyme and garlic; and cook for a further 2 minutes until the mushrooms are softened. Sauce – Add chicken stock/broth and reduce by half. Add marsala; cream; pepper and remaining reserved roasting juices. Simmer on medium / medium high for 5 minutes until it reduces by half and the sauce is thickened. Taste – it should be slightly on the salty side (which will seem just right with each mouthful of beef). Add more salt if needed. Serve with beef.
https://www.recipetineats.com/brie-dauphinoise-potatoes/, Cream Mixture: Place butter; cream and garlic in a jug. Mix until combined. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (both fan and standard ovens). Slice potatoes: Peel the potatoes and slice them 1/8"/3 mm thick. Or use a slicer! Layer 1: Spread 1/3 of the potatoes in a 1.5 litre / 6 cup baking dish (Note 5). Then pour over 1/3 of the Cream Mixture; scatter with 1/3 of the salt; pepper and thyme.  Layers 2 & 3: Repeat for the 2nd and third layer. Cover & bake: Cover with foil; and bake for 1 hour 20 minutes or until the potatoes in the middle are soft (use knife to test); it might take 1 1/2 hours. (Note 6) Top with brie; bake again: Remove foil. Place brie on the surface; cut side down. Bake for a further 30 minutes until the brie is oozy and the edges tinged with gold.  Serve – Stand 5 minutes before serving and be prepared to swoon!
https://www.recipetineats.com/seafood-platter/, Purchase all seafood as close as possible to the serving date. We often do the 5AM shop at the Sydney Fish Markets on Christmas Eve; because we are slightly crazy! We don't order online (we like to choose our own).  Storage – Cooked seafood will easily keep 2 days; fresh raw for cooking will too if you take it out of the plastic bags; put in a colander or similar and very loosely cover with cling wrap (breathing = less stinky). Crab – To cut the crab; follow directions in How to Cut a Whole Crab except DO NOT cut off the claws if you are using a Blue Swimmer Crab. (See note) Moreton Bay bug – To cut the bug; flip it on to its back. Cut down through the middle (the shell is not too hard). Clean out the yellow and brown matter in the head; then it's ready to serve. Recipe video above. Sauce – Make your sauces of choice. They will be used for dipping prawns; Moreton Bay bugs and crab (I also use for vegetable sticks and bread!). Refrigerate until required (2 days+). Mussels – Make mussels; if using. Great served at room temperature on a cold seafood platter. Ice (optional) – Cover a large platter with ice. This keeps the seafood cold as well as providing a non-slip bed.  Pile the prawns; crab and bugs on to the platter. Drape smoked salmon randomly around. Fan out the sushi. Oysters – Place them level to avoid the juices in the shells spilling out (what a waste!). Mussels – Break off one shell; and serve in the remaining shell. Then place the mussels in a single layer; or shingled (stacked but level). Spoon on a little of the diced vegetables and some reserved mussel cooking liquor. Sauce and lemon – Nestle bowls filled with sauces amongst the seafood and scatter over lemon wedges. Serve alongside finger bowls for cleaning and bowls to discard shells; and lots of napkins. Fill glasses with wine; cheers to Christmas! Now dive in!
https://www.recipetineats.com/mini-christmas-cakes-gift/, Heat – Place dried fruit and juice/brandy in a large microwavable container. Microwave 1 1/2 minutes on high or until hot. Soak – Stir to coat all fruit in liquid. Cover then set aside for 1 hour (to plump up/soak and cool). Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (140°C fan). Grease and line a 20cm / 8" square cake pan with baking paper / parchment paper; or larger pan to get more cakes out of it. (Note 5 on pan size). Beating – Using an electric beater; beat butter and sugar until smooth and creamy (about 1 minute on speed 5). Add oil and molasses; beat until combined. Add salt; spices and baking powder – beat until incorporated. Add eggs; one at a time; beating until just incorporated. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon; then the dried fruit (including all the extra liquid in bowl) and walnuts (if using). Pour into the cake pan; it will fill it right to the top (it won't spill over; the cake barely rises). Cover the surface with paper then cover with foil.  Bake 2 1/2 hours – Bake for 2 hours; remove the foil and paper; then bake for a further 30 minutes. A skewer inserted into middle should come out clean with no batter on it. Remove from oven and cool for 20 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Cool completely before cutting. Cutting – Trim off the sides (to make them neat). Then cut into 9 squares (or more; if you want). Trim the surface (to make them level as the cake slightly domes). Then flip upside down and decorate the base of the cake.  Simple – Dust with icing sugar. That's all this cake needs; it's so full flavoured and moist! Wrap with cellophane and ribbon to gift. Ribbon – Wrap and tie a ribbon around each cake. Nice way to present for serving. (Optional to include for gift wrapping too; but then there's a double ribbon situation happening – ie ribbon and cake; ribbon on cellophane!) Drippy white glaze  – Mix the icing sugar; butter; vanilla and start with 2 tbsp milk. Mix really well (it will take time to come together; be patient). Then adjust thickness using 1/2 tsp milk at a time. BE CAREFUL – it goes from too thick to too thin very easily! Goal: Thick glaze that will ooze "pudding style"; as pictured; rather than dripping in long streaks. Spoon onto cake; coaxing it down the sides. Allow to set before wrapping. Fondant – See directions in my classic round Christmas Cake. Serving – serve with custard for a traditional experience! Either homemade custard or store bought pouring custard.
https://www.recipetineats.com/qeema-indian-curried-beef/, Sauté – Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add ginger and garlic and saute for 30 seconds until golden; don't let it burn! Add onion and cook for 1 minute until it is starting to turn translucent. Add beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; until it changes from pink to light brown. Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT water. Cook for a further 2 minutes to let the spices bloom. Cook 10 minutes – Add water; give it a stir; then put a lid on (or cover with a baking tray). Turn heat down to medium and let it simmer for 10 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated. Serve over with basmati rice or plain white rice; garnished with extra chilli and coriander/cilantro; and lots of Mint Yogurt. Naan or flatbreads would make it even better; though if time is not your friend; try frozen roti (pictured in post; Note 3). Blitz then stir – Put just 1/4 cup of the yogurt with the mint leaves and salt in a jug just big enough to fit the head of a stick blender. Blitz until mint is very finely chopped. Then stir in remaining yogurt. (Note 4) Refrigerate until required.
https://www.recipetineats.com/holiday-stuffed-sweet-potato-with-bacon-pecans-sage/, Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan forced). Bake  – Prick the skin of the potatoes 15 times with a fork. Place on a foil lined baking tray and bake for 75 minutes or until soft all the way through (check with a butter knife). Scoop – Once potatoes cooked; allow to cool for 10 minutes just to handle. Cut in half lengthwise then scoop out the flesh; leaving a 0.5cm (0.2") wall (use a tea towel if hot). Place flesh in a bowl. Stuffing (*see below for prepping components*)- Mash the potatoes with a fork. Then add the browned butter; 1/2 tsp salt; pepper; garlic; onion powder and paprika. The add half of each the pecans; bacon and cheese (rest reserved for toppings). Stir until combined. Stuff – Place halved sweet potato back on a paper lined baking tray and stuff them equally with filling. Sprinkle with leftover cheese and bake for 25 minutes until cheese is melted. Crunchy topping – Top with reserved pecans; bacon and panko mixture. Bake for another 3 to 4 minutes Rest for 5 minutes then serve! Prepare these while the potatoes are baking. Browned butter – Melt the butter in a small silver pan or saucepan over medium heat. Leave to simmer on medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes; stirring every now and then; until (when you push foam aside) you see little golden-brown bits and it smells nutty. Immediately pour into a small bowl (including the golden bits) and set aside. Toast pecans – Heat a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Add pecans and toast for 2 to 3 minutes until they have golden spots. Transfer to cutting board; cool then finely chop. Crispy bacon – Add bacon into the same pan over medium heat. When the fat starts to melt; turn the heat up to medium high and cook until golden (4 to 5 minutes). Scoop out bacon with a slotted spoon and place into a small bowl. Leave leftover fat in the pan. Golden panko – Still on medium high; add the Panko topping ingredients. Stir until golden; around 2 minutes; then scrape into a bowl.
https://www.recipetineats.com/southern-thai-tumeric-chicken-grilled-or-baked/, Marinade chicken – Mix Marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Marinade for at least 3 hours; preferably overnight.  Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Prepare – Line a tray with baking paper/parchment paper. Place chicken on the tray; skin side up. Scrape all Marinade out of th bowl and dab onto chicken. Bake for 40 minutes; basting at the 30 minute and 40 minute mark using the tray juices to make it golden brown and sticky; and rotate the tray as needed for even colour. Increase the oven temperature to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan-forced). Pop the chicken back in for a final 10 minutes to caramelise the skin. Rest for 3 minutes before serving with jasmine or coconut rice; and plain chunks of tomato and cucumber the Thai way!
https://www.recipetineats.com/mini-chocolate-cakes/, Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan-forced). Baking pan – Butter a 40 x 28.5 x 2.5cm cm tray (15.8 x 11.3 x 1" – US standard jelly roll pan) then line with baking paper (parchment paper). Whisk dry – Sift the flour; cocoa; baking powder and baking soda into a bowl. Add the sugar and salt; then whisk to combine. Mix in wet – Add the egg; milk; oil and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Dissolve the coffee in the hot water; then add into the batter. Whisk to combine. The batter will be VERY thin! Bake – Pour into the pan and bake for 13 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes then use the paper overhang to lift the cake onto a rack and cool for 30 minutes (leave it on the paper). Then refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour before cutting rounds (cake is too soft when freshly baked). Cutting rounds – Cover the sticky surface with paper. Then flip upside down onto a cutting board (ie sticky side down). (Note 4) Peel the paper off the base. Then press out 21 x 6cm / 2.4" rounds (or other size or shape as you desire). Pipe frosting – Place a piece of cake on a small piece of paper; using a dab of frosting to stop it from sliding. Pipe coils of frosting on the layers; using 3 rounds for each cake. Pipe frosting around the sides and on the top. (A cake turntable is handy if you've got one but not essential.) Smooth frosting – Smooth the frosting using a small offset spatula or knife; taking care to only touch the surface. Avoid touching the cake because it will dislodge crumbs that will end up in your frosting! Decorate with piles of chocolate shards. I also used raspberries and rosemary for the photos in the post! Beat butter for 3 minutes on high until soft and fluffy. Add icing sugar in 3 lots. Beat it in; starting on low speed then increasing the speed (to avoid a snow storm). Once incorporated; add more icing sugar and repeat. Beat 3 minutes – Once the icing sugar has all been added; added the cocoa powder; milk and vanilla. Beat again; starting on low speed then increasing the speed gradually. Once the cocoa is incorporated; beat on high for 3 minutes to make it really nice and fluffy.  Piping bags – Transfer to a piping bag for frosting. (This is the fastest and easiest way; trust me on this. Even a ziplock bag will work here).
https://www.recipetineats.com/green-beans-with-a-mountain-of-panko/, Toss blanched beans with oil; salt and pepper. Whisk Tahini ingredients; microwave 20 seconds; whisk again.

Preheat a large non-stick pan on medium high. Add the panko mixture and stir for 4 – 5 minutes until golden brown. Transfer back into the bowl then let it cool. Whipped Tahini Yogurt – Whisk ingredients in a heat-proof bowl just to combine. Microwave for just 20 seconds on high; then whisk again for 10 seconds – it will resemble softly whipped cream. (Note 4) Use immediately or at room temperature. Assemble – Spread green beans on plate. Pour over sauce; pile on panko. Attack!
https://www.recipetineats.com/lamb-souvlaki/, Mix marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add lamb and toss to coat. Marinate in fridge for 12 – 24 hours. Skewer – Remove meat from marinade and thread 3 to 4 pieces on each to make 12 skewers; or 5 to make 8 larger skewers (pictured in post).  Sprinkle the meat with the salt and pepper. (This really makes a difference to the finished dish; better than just in the marinade). Cook – Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat. Cook half the skewers for 3 minutes; turn then cook the other side for 3 minutes until nicely seared (target internal temp 60°C/140°F for medium rare; optimum juiciness). Transfer to a plate and loosely cover with foil to keep warm while you cook the remaining skewers. Soak skewers – Soak wood/bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes if planning to cook on the BBQ (prevents burning). My skewers are 18cm/7” which fit in a pan (stove cooking). Preheat BBQ to medium high. Flat iron hot plate is safer for wooden skewers (so they don't catch fire) else use metal skewers on the grill side. Skewer; oil & season – Skewer per above. Drizzle with the oil (so it doesn't stick to the BBQ) then sprinkle both sides with the salt and pepper. BBQ cook for 3 minutes on each side. Pile Souvlaki onto a serving platter for DIY wraps with tzatziki (from this recipe); toasted pita bread and Greek salad (chopped small); or shredded lettuce and tomato slices. Else; make plates with lemon rice and a Greek Salad!
https://www.recipetineats.com/melting-moments/, Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan-forced). Line 2 trays with paper. Cream butter – Place butter; vanilla and icing sugar in a bowl. Beat for 1 minute until smooth and fluffy (start on low to avoid an icing sugar cloud-storm). Dry in 3 lots – Stir in cornflour and flour in 3 lots using a rubber spatula. (ie add 1/3 of flour + cornflour; stir in; repeat twice more). Scoop 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto the trays (cookie scoop handy here); then roll into balls using lightly floured hands (to prevent it from sticking). You should have 24 – 28 balls. Bake – Press down into 1 cm / 0.4" thickness using a fork. Bake for 15 minutes; switching the trays at the 10 minute mark. Fully cool on trays. Sandwiching – Pipe frosting onto half the melting moments; then sandwich with remaining cookies. Set – Refrigerate for 1 hour to set the frosting (else it's so soft; it squirts out!). Then remove from the fridge 30 minutes prior to serving. Cream butter – Place butter in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium high for 1 minute until smooth and fluffy. Add 1/3 of the icing sugar; then beat in starting on low and increasing to high (to avoid snow-storm!). Repeat another 2 times. Beat 2 minutes – Add lemon zest and juice. Then beat on high for 2 minutes until fluffy. Transfer to piping bag; snip end off to make a 1cm / 1/2" hole. Use per recipe. Same method as above for lemon icing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/favourite-avocado-salad/, Put all the salad ingredients in large bowl. Drizzle over lime juice and oil; sprinkle with salt; pepper and red chilli flakes.

https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pan-baked-butter-chicken/, Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan-forced). Coat chicken – Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl; then add the chicken and toss to coat. Optional marinade – overnight. (Note 5) Assemble – Mix Sauce ingredients in a 23 x 33cm / 9 x 13" baking dish. Place chicken in; smooth side up. Scrape residual marinade out of bowl and dab onto chicken surface. Bake 45 minutes; basting with sauce at the 30 minute and 40 minute mark. The sauce will change from pink to orangey-red (Note 6 for sauce thickening). Serve – Rest for 5 minutes. Then serve over basmati rice; garnished with coriander if desired! Naan for mopping would make everyone extra happy. 🙂
https://www.recipetineats.com/fondant-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan-forced). Carve / cut each potato into cylinders ~ 6cm/ 2" diameter; 7 cm height. Then cut in half so you have 8 short cylinders 3.5 cm / 1.4" tall. See cutting method options below. Season – Pat potato dry. Place in a large bowl and toss with half the oil plus all the salt and pepper. Sear – In an ovenproof heavy based skillet (Note 2); heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil over medium high heat. Put the potato in and cook each side for 6 – 8 minutes or until golden. Cook – Add butter and thyme. Once melted; spoon the butter over the potato ("basting"). Add stock; bring to a boil then transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the potatoes are tender; basting at the 15 minute mark. The stock will be absorbed by the potato; leaving just butter. Serve – Baste one more time then serve! For a restaurant-y option; serve alongside steak with béarnaise sauce and buttered peas. Prep for all methods – Trim a bit off both ends so the potato stands upright. Once carved into a tall cylinder 6cm/ 2" diameter; at least 7cm/3" height; so we can cut into 3.5 cm / 1.4" tall pieces. Save leftover potato to make mash (keep in water to prevent turning brown). Pro method – Lie potato on its side and use a knife to carve around to form a cylinder.  Intermediate (I do this)– Stand potato upright and use a knife to shave thin slivers down; rotating as needed; to carve into a cylinder. You can use a potato peeler for some of this too (just be a bit careful; less control). Easy – Use 6cm/ 2" (or as close as possible) wide cutters to press rounds out! Easy potato peeler – Use a potato peeler to shape as best you can; rotating as you go. Doesn't matter! – Just cut potatoes into 3.5cm / 1.4" thick slices! Even if your rounds are not so round; it will still taste delicious. Only cut enough to fill the pan; as pictured; else you'll have too much potato for the stock being used (flavour dilution);
https://www.recipetineats.com/penne-all-arrabbiata-spicy-tomato-pasta/, Sauté – Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and stir for 10 seconds. Add cayenne and chilli flakes. Cook for 1 minute; or until garlic is light golden. Add tomato; salt and pepper. Rinse out the tomato cans with the water and add into the pot. Simmer – Turn up the heat to high; stir; then once it comes to a simmer; turn back down to medium heat and simmer for 15 minutes. (Taste check at 10 min – if sour; add the sugar.) Cook pasta – Meanwhile; bring a large pot of water to the boil with the 1 tablespoon of salt. Add pasta and cook per packet directions. Save water – Just before draining; give the pot a big stir (to agitate the starch) then scoop out 1 cup of the water and set aside. (Note 4) Drain pasta. Toss – Add pasta into the sauce along with 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Toss well (still on the stove) until the pasta is coated with the pasta sauce. Use extra pasta cooking water if needed; to loosen. Serve – Divide between bowls and serve immediately with parmesan and parsley; if using.

Crumb – Put the flour; sugar; cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and mix together with a fork. Then add the butter and vanilla; and use the fork to mix until all the flour is wet; then stop mixing. We want it lumpy and crumbly! Zest the lemon first and put it aside for the batter before measuring out juice for the blueberry tossing. Blueberries – Toss the blueberries with lemon juice to wet the surface. Sprinkle with sugar and flour; toss to coat. Set aside. Whisk dry – Whisk the flour; baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Whisk wet – In a larger bowl; whisk the sugar; vanilla; zest and eggs until the surface is a bit foamy (~ 15 sec by hand). Add the butter and sour cream; whisk until smooth. Combine wet and dry – Switch to a rubber spatula. Add the flour in 3 batches; folding in between until the flour is mostly incorporated. Then add the milk and stir until combined. Some small lumps is ok! Assembling – Pour the batter into the pan. Scatter blueberries on top. Sprinkle any leftover flour at the bottom of the blueberry bowl on top of the blueberries. Cover with chunks of crumb; aiming for ~85% coverage. If necessary; enclose powdery bits in your fist to press them into clumps! Bake for 65 minutes; rotating the pan halfway; until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean (blueberry smear is ok!). Cool 10 minutes in the pan. Remove the cake from the springform pan then cool for at least another 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Serving – For the best blueberry crumble-cake experience; serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Otherwise; be normal and serve it at room temperature. Ice cream or cream also welcome here.
https://www.recipetineats.com/almost-no-oil-pan-fried-eggplant/, Cut the eggplant into 2cm / 0.8” rounds.  Spray each side generously with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brown – Heat a large non-stick pan with a lid over medium high heat; no oil. (Note 3) Add the eggplant slices and pan fry for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side or until you get some nice browning on it. As much or as little as you want! Pan steam – Carefully add water around the eggplant (it will bubble and steam; so do this carefully). Then immediately cover with a lid to trap the steam in. Steam for 2 minutes or until the water has evaporated.  Check – Use a butter knife to check to ensure the eggplant is cooked through. If not; add a bit more water and steam again! Serve – Transfer to a serving plate and serve! Great as is; or to dress it up a tiny bit; add a swish of olive oil; squeeze of lemon juice and parsley leaves; or a smear of chilli crisp!

https://www.recipetineats.com/pierogi-ruskie-polish-dumplings/, Boil potatoes – Put potato and 1 tbsp salt in a large saucepan. Add cold tap water so it's 3cm/1 inch above potatoes. Bring to a boil on high heat then reduce heat to medium high and simmer for 15 minutes or until potatoes are soft. Mash – Drain; then pass the potatoes through a potato ricer into a bowl (or use potato masher) Cheese it – Immediately add butter; cheese; salt and pepper. Mix with a wooden spoon until fully combined. Cool – Spread out ~1cm / 1/2" thick on a tray. Cover with cling wrap; pressing so it is fully in contact. Cool on the counter (~30 min) then refrigerate until cold (1 hour+). Melt butter – Heat up the water and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat just until butter is melted; do not boil water. (Or do this in the microwave). Turn off heat. Mix dough – Whisk the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and then add the butter water plus egg. Mix to combine into a shaggy dough. Knead – Scrape out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 5 minutes until the dough becomes smooth (Note 3). You could also use your stand mixer. Rest – Wrap with cling wrap and leave on the counter for 30 minutes. Roll & cut – On a lightly floured surface; roll out the dough to 3mm / 1/8" thickness. Cut out rounds using a 7.5 cm / 3" cutter. Do as many as you can; then gather surplus dough into a ball; wrap with cling wrap and set aside for later. Fill & wrap – Place 1 tablespoon of cheesy potato filling in the middle of a round. Dip finger with water and run along edge of half the circle. Fold dough over to enclose the filling and press to seal; making slight indents (no pleats). Wrap remaining – Place them on a lightly floured tray and continue to wrap remaining Pierogi (including rolling out the remaining dough). You should get ~30 pierogis. In a non stick skillet; melt the butter until foamy over medium heat. Add onion and salt; then cook; stirring regularly; for 10 to 15 minutes until golden on the edges. Scrape out into a bowl; then set aside (OK to cool). Batch cooking – Directions below are for cooking and serving 10. Boil pierogis in batches of 10 to 12 max; they need space to bounce around in the water; and you need space to toss them in the butter. (Note 4 for big batch cooking) Boil 5 minutes – Bring ~3 litres/quarts of water to the boil with 1 tbsp salt. Lower 10 piergosi into the water. Cook for 5 minutes – they should be floating on the surface. Reserve water & drain – Dip a jug into the water and scoop out ~1 cup water. Then use a slotted spoon to transfer pierogi into a bowl (or drain; if not cooking more). Butter sauce – Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1/3 of the onion butter plus the cooked pierogis with 2 tablespoons of the reserved cooking water. Toss for 1 minute; still on the stove; until the pierogis are coated in the butter. (Note 4 on scaling up) Serve – Slide onto a serving plate; scraping out every drop of butter. Sprinkle with parsley; add a dollop of sour cream. Eat and be happy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/hasselback-potatoes/, Hasselback slice 2mm thick. Rub/sprinkle with 1 1/2 tsp oil and 1/4 tsp salt. Bake 200°C/400°F (180°C fan) for 30 min. Pour over oil; sprinkle with salt; throw garlic and rosemary on tray. Bake further 40 min; basting generously every 10 min (getting oil between slices key); until cooked. Crank up to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan); baste; bake 10 – 15 min until extra golden. Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan-forced). Cut prep – Cut a thin slice off the base of a potato to make it sit flat while cutting. Place the potato between 2 wooden spatulas or chopsticks (no thicker than 1cm / 0.4" – Note 4); to make it impossible for you to accidentally cut all the way through! THIN slices – Cut the potato into very thin slices; aiming for 2 mm. The cuts on the edges of the potato can be slightly thicker as the edges bake up crisper. (Note 4 for tips) Rub – Drizzle each potato the 1 1/2 tsp oil then sprinkle/rub with the 1/4 tsp salt (ie share across all). Bake 1 – Place the potatoes on a tray. Bake for 30 minutes; then remove from oven. Baste 1 – The potato slices should be slightly less "stuck" together at this stage. Pour the 1/4 cup olive oil over the potatoes then sprinkle the salt evenly over. The salt gets spread later; so don't worry if it looks like a lot! Throw the garlic and rosemary on the tray. Baking/basting – Bake the potatoes for another 40 minutes; basting with the oil on the tray every 10 minutes. Brush with a bit of pressure across the surface of the potatoes to encourage the oil and salt to drip down. Once oil gets between the slices; they will fan out more and more. CRISP IT! – Once the potatoes are soft in the centre (check with knife); turn the oven UP to 220°C/425°F (200°C). Baste the potatoes again then bake for a further 10 – 15 minutes until the edges are nice and golden. I am quite bold with this step; many others do not seek as much crispy edges. Serve immediately while hot and the edges are crispy! Peeling off those end bits are the BEST.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-ragu-pasta/, Toast & grind – Preheat a large deep skillet or pot over medium heat (Note 5); no oil. Toast black peppercorn and fennel for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until it smells fragrant and the fennel is lightly browned. Transfer to a mortar and use a pestle and grind to a powder while still hot. Coat fish – Transfer to a medium bowl with remaining Calabrian spiced fish ingredients. Stir well with a spatula until combined. Set aside. Cook pasta – Boil 3 litres of water with the cooking salt. Cook pasta per packet directions minus 1 minute. Just before draining; scoop out 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking water. Then drain in a colander and leave until ready to use. Calabrian fish ragu – While the pasta is cooking; heat olive oil in the same skillet you used to toast the fennel on medium high. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the fish. Cook for 2 minutes; stirring regularly. Add tomato passata. Simmer for 5 minutes; stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water and simmer for 2 minutes. Toss pasta – Add pasta and 3/4 of the parsley. Toss for 1 minute to coat the pasta with the sauce. Most of the fish will break up into flakes but some will remain in larger chunks – this is good! We don't want disintegrated mush; nor giant chunks. Once the pasta turns red and the sauce and fish bits are clinging to the pasta straws; remove from heat and divide between bowls immediately. Serve – Sprinkle with pasta; pangrattato and parmesan. Eat immediately! Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan-forced). Toss bread; oil and salt in a small bowl. Spread on a tray and bake for 10 minutes; tossing at the 5 minute mark; or until light golden and fully crisp.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-cream-pie/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160° fan-forced). Cut round paper – Cut a round piece of baking / parchment paper; the size of the pie dish (to prevent skin forming on custard). (Note 5)  Blitz – Break up Oreos roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz into crumbs (~10 sec). Add butter; blitz to mix through. Mixture should resemble wet sand. (No food processor? Bash in ziplock bag with a rolling pin). Press – Pour into a 23cm / 9" pie dish. Spread crumbs out and press firmly into the base and up the walls using your hands; spatula or something flat. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven – the crust will be slightly puffed. Press down gently using a rubber spatula (makes it even crustier!) then allow to cool on the counter before filling. Whisk dry; then wet – Place cornflour; sugar and salt in a large saucepan. Whisk to combine. Add milk; cream and yolks. Whisk to combine. Heat to thicken – Turn heat onto medium high. As the mixture warms up; whisk every now and then; but not constantly. As the liquid starts to get hot at around the 3 – 5 minute mark (you'll see steam); turn the stove down to medium low and start to whisk constantly. You will feel and see the mixture start to thicken. Got lumps? See Note 6! 45 second whisk – When you see slow; lazy bubbles (~6 minutes; you will need to pause whisking to see bubbles); whisk constantly for 45 seconds then take it off the stove. Chocolate and butter – Add butter; chocolate and vanilla. Whisk until chocolate melts and filling is smooth.  Pour hot filling into pie crust; filling it right to the top; smooth surface. Gently place round baking paper on surface. (Surplus custard? Note 7) Cool on the counter for 2 hours then refrigerate for 12+ hours to allow the custard to fully set. Whipped cream – Beat whipped cream ingredients in a bowl on high for 2 to 3 minutes until softly whipped. Topping – Carefully peel back paper. Pile on the whipped cream; then grate chocolate across the surface. Serving – Keep the pie in the pie tin. Cut and serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/maple-roasted-pumpkin-with-chili-and-feta/, Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan-forced). Toss – Place the pumpkin; onion and walnuts on a large; paper lined tray. Drizzle with olive oil and maple syrup; then toss to coat (hands really is best). Sprinkle with chilli and salt; toss again; then spread out on a tray. Don't crowd them else they will stew instead of roast! Roast for 30 minutes; or until the pumpkin is lightly browned and cooked through; tossing once at the 20 minute mark. Finishes – Remove from the oven. Gently toss again; then transfer to a serving platter in a single layer. Crumble over feta; sprinkle with parsley and chilli. Or do the sprinkling on the tray then pile into a bowl. Serve immediately!

Coat chicken; fry at 180°C/350°F for 4 min (don't touch for first 90 sec). Assemble! Full instructions: Chicken – Cover the chicken with a freezer bag or plastic sheet and pound to 1cm / 0.4" even thickness. Trim to just a touch larger than the size of your bun. Save off-cuts for another use (stir fry – or Dozer; in my case!). Marinade – Whisk Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add chicken; toss. Marinate in the fridge for 3 hours minimum; to overnight (don't go beyond 24 hrs). Garlic mayo – Mix in a small bowl and refrigerate until required. Prepare crunchy coating – Mix flour; cornflour and Seasoning ingredients in a bowl. Drizzle over 2 tablespoons of the marinade; then use fingers to mix through to form lumps – when this sticks to the chicken; it fries up into awesome crunchy bits!! Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium high heat to 180°C/350°F (Note 2). Coat chicken – Pick up a piece of chicken and allow excess marinade to drip off. Press to coat in flour coating. Shake off excess; then fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden. DO NOT TOUCH for the first 90 seconds to allow the coating to adhere. I fry 2 at a time. Drain on paper towels; cook remaining chicken. Assemble – Smear garlic mayo on the top and bottom of the buns. Pile lettuce on the base; top with tomato if using. Then chicken; gherkins and put the lid on. Sink your teeth into it immediately and enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/miso-butter-corn/, Miso butter – Mix butter and miso together in a small bowl until combined. Golden bacon – Put bacon in an unheated large non stick pan; no oil. Turn the stove onto medium high heat – as it heats up; the fat will start to melt so the bacon cooks in its own fat. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until golden; then use a slotted spoon to transfer onto a paper towel lined plate. Reserve bacon fat in the pan. Cook corn – Top up with butter if you don’t have 1 tbsp fat left in pan. Still on medium high; add corn; then stir only every minute or so (this lets it get some nice golden spots); for about 5 minutes until corn is just cooked and is sweet. Add garlic; stir for another 30 seconds. Add sake; stir until evaporated (~15 seconds). Melt miso butter – Turn off stove. Add miso butter; stir until melted. Add pepper; bacon and green onion; toss until coated with sauce. Serve! Serve as a side dish. In a corn taco with a fried egg and avocado (OMG SO GOOD).
https://www.recipetineats.com/basque-cheesecake/, See below for full length written recipe. Shorthand recipe is for experienced bakers. Prep – Preheat oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan) with the shelf in the middle. Press scrunched paper into 20cm/8" springform pan. Batter – Beat cream cheese 2 minutes on medium. Beat in sugar on low speed for 10 seconds. In separate bowl; hand whisk 1/4 cup cream with the flour (becomes like paste). Whisk in remaining cream and vanilla. While beating on low; slowly pour cream into cream cheese; then eggs (don't overbeat). Bake – Pour into pan; bang pan on counter; pop bubbles with knife. Bake 45 min (up to 65 min possible; Note 8) until top deep golden. Cool 2 hrs on counter then 8 hrs+ in fridge uncovered. Ready for serving! Preheat oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan) with the shelf in the middle of the oven. Pan prep (Note 4) – Press 2 x 40cm/16" sheets of scrunched up baking/parchment paper arranged in an "X" into a 20cm/8" springform pan (6cm / 2.5" tall); and fold down over the rim to hold in place. You'll need to scrunch/pleat to fit which creates the signature rustic sides! The batter will weigh it down so don't worry if it doesn't stay in. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium speed for 2 minutes; scraping down the sides as needed; until smooth and lump-free. Add sugar and beat on low speed for 10 seconds. Flour & cream (Note 6) – Put about 1/4 of the cream and all the flour in a medium bowl. Hand whisk until lump free (it will be paste-like); then slowly pour in the remaining cream while whisking. Once flour is incorporated; whisk in vanilla. (PS not making whipped cream here! Should be pourable) Slowly pour the cream into the cream cheese bowl with the beater going on low. Beat just until combined. Then slowly pour the eggs in while the beater is still on low speed. As soon as the eggs are incorporated; stop beating to minimise getting bubbles in the batter (Note 7). Remove air bubbles – Pour into the prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter then pop bubbles that rise to the surface with a small sharp knife. I do repeat 3 to 5 times. (Note 7) Bake 45 minutes or until the surface is a deep golden brown. It can take up to 65 minutes and that's fine! (Seriously; read Note 8) Keep a close eye on it for the last 15 minutes; you want it deeply golden but not burnt. The centre will still be wobbly and the cake will rise like a soufflé. Chill overnight – Cool in the cake pan for at least 2 hours on the counter (it will sink; that's normal). Then refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours; uncovered.  Serving – Release the sides of the springform pan. Hold excess paper overhang to lift off base onto a cutting board or plate. Fold down sides – I love serving it on the paper; it's part of the visuals! Bring to room temp for 30 minutes if time permits; though also great served chilled. Cut like cake! Eat as is – doesn't need cream; berries etc.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roast-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan). Smashed garlic – Place side of knife on unpeeled garlic clove. Hit firmly with palm of hand so the garlic bursts open a bit but mostly stays in tact. Toss – Put potatoes on a tray and push together. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Toss through thyme and garlic. Spread out on tray.  Roast 1 hour – Roast for 30 minutes. Toss. Roast for a further 25 to 35 minutes; or until the potatoes are golden. (Note 4 for stuck potatoes & golden TIPS!) Serve – Sprinkle with parsley; if using; and serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-pork-sausage-patties/, Make patties – Place sausage pattie ingredients in a bowl and mix well with your hands. Divide into 8 and form 1 cm / 0.4" thick patties. Make a shallow dent in the middle of the surface – this prevents the patties from doming as they cook. Cook 4 minutes – Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook half the patties for 2 minutes on each side until golden. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate. Heat remaining oil and cook remaining patties. Serve with ketchup! (See recipe card intro for serving ideas)
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-wontons-in-chilli-sauce-din-tai-fung/, Mix spices – Put the garlic; sugar; chilli flakes; sichuan pepper; five spices and stock powder in a medium mixing bowl. Heat oil – Heat the chilli oil and vegetable oil in a small frying pan over medium heat until hot. Pour over garlic mixture. Enjoy the sizzle! (Don't worry; it doesn't spit) Add sauces: – Whisk in soy sauce; rice vinegar and hot water. The oil will remain a little separated on top. Set aside while you make wontons. Cook wontons – Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Add wontons and cook until they float: 4 minutes for freshly made; 6 to 8 minutes from frozen. Assemble – Transfer to serving dish using a slotted spoon. Pour over sauce; add an extra drizzle of chilli oil (if you dare!); sprinkle with green onion. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/bok-choy-in-ginger-sauce/, Cutting – Trim the base of the bok choy then separate all the leaves. Leave the delicate baby bok choy in the centre intact; it's precious! Cut giant stems in half lengthwise so they are all roughly the same size. Rinse in colander; shake off excess water (don't need to dry fully). Sauce – Stir Sauce ingredients except water in a jug until cornflour is dissolved. (Easier to make lump free with less liquid). Then stir in water. Gingery oil – Put the ginger and oil in a large non-stick pan. Turn onto medium heat. Once the ginger starts sizzling; sauté for 1 minute until it turns light golden and is a bit floppy. Add bok choy then use 2 spatulas to toss the ginger for around 15 seconds to coat. Steam – Turn heat up to medium; pour water over. Cover with lid and steam for just 45 seconds. Sauce – Remove lid (bok choy will still be a bit underdone); pour in sauce; toss for 30 seconds until sauce changes from murky to clear; and thickens. Bok choy should be just floppy but still soft crunch; not mushy. If your sauce gets too thick (Note 4); add a tiny splash of water and mix. Serve – Pour the bok choy and all the sauce onto a serving plate; then eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/golden-coconut-chicken-curry/, Spice mix – Mix the spices in a small bowl. Toast – Heat the oil in a large heavy based pot over medium high heat. Toast the star anise and cinnamon for 2 minutes. Add onion; cook for 2 minutes.  Add chicken; cook for 3 minutes or it's no longer pink on the outside (still raw inside). Add aromatics – Add garlic; ginger and turmeric. Cook for 1 minute. Add spice mix and stir for 30 seconds. Simmer 12 minutes – Add stock and coconut cream. Stir and bring to an energetic simmer. Cook for 12 minutes (no need to stir) so the sauce thickens slightly. Add broccoli florets. Bring back to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes or until softened. Serve – Cool for 5 minutes; this will allow the sauce to thicken slightly. Then stir in coriander and serve with rice (basmati or jasmine especially nice). Garnish with extra coriander and crispy fried shallots.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-bars/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (160C fan). Spray a 20cm/8" square tin with oil and line with baking/parchment paper with overhang (so it can be lifted out once cooked). Base – Place Shortbread Base ingredients in a food processor fitted with the standard "S" blade. Pulse 5 to 10 times until it becomes like sand. (Or use tips of fingers; Note 2). Pour into the tin; spread; then press firmly into the base; pushing it right up to the edges. Using something flat to press in is helpful! Bake base for 20 minutes or until golden on the edges and pale golden in the middle. Remove from oven. (⚠️ Note: don't let it cool; pour in curd immediately). Lemon Curd – While the base is baking; place Lemon Topping ingredients in a bowl and whisk until combined. Bake 20 minutes – Pour Lemon Curd onto base; then bake for 20 minutes until the topping is set but still soft. Cool – Remove from then oven and cool on the counter for 1 hour; then fridge for at least 2 hours. Slice into 16 squares. Dust with icing sugar (confectionary sugar) and serve! 
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-noodles/, Noodles – Cook the noodles in a large saucepan per packet directions. Scoop out ~1/2 cup cooking water. Strain noodles and set aside. Sauce – Melt butter in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook; stirring until soft. Add oyster sauce; fish sauce; Maggi seasoning and 1/4 cup cooking water. Stir to combine. Toss – Add cooked noodles; parmesan and green onion. Toss until the noodles are all coated; and the sauce is not pooled in the bottom of the saucepan. Add more cooking water 1 tbsp at the time; if needed to loosen the noodles. Serve immediately! Serving suggestion: fried egg and broccolini cooked with the noodles*; tossed with Asian Sesame Dressing you always have in your fridge. 🙂* Broccolini takes about 3 minutes; so put it into the water before/after/with the noodles depending on the noodle cooking time.
https://www.recipetineats.com/farro-salad-with-sizzled-dressing/, Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Roast tomatoes and toast farro – Toss tomatoes on a tray with the olive oil; salt and pepper. Spread farro on a separate tray. Put both in the oven; farro on the top shelf; tomatoes underneath. Bake for 8 minutes; shaking the trays halfway. The farro should be browned with a nutty flavour; the tomatoes should be a bit wrinkly but still holding their shape. Cool tomatoes on the tray while you prep everything else. Cook farro (Note 1) – Put the toasted farro in a saucepan with the vinegar; water and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to medium so it is simmering. Cover with lid then simmer for 40 – 45 minutes or until all/most of the liquid is absorbed and the farro is ready. It should still have a bite to it (not soft like pasta) but not a hard centre. Add more water if needed; and keep cooking – don't be afraid to cook it softer if you want. Drain off excess liquid; if there is any; then transfer to a large bowl. (Taste: a bit tangy; the "vinegar" component used in salad dressings!) Pile eschallots on top. Let farro cool to room temp. Sizzling garlic cumin dressing – Heat oil in a small pan over medium low heat. Add coriander and cumin; cook for 30 seconds until light golden and you can smell it. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds until light golden. Assembling – Immediately pour hot oil over eschallots so it semi-cooks it. Toss. Add spinach; toss. Add tomatoes; gently stir through (some tomato collapsing is encouraged). Pour 1/3 into a serving bowl; crumble over 1/3 goats cheese. Repeat twice more; finishing with goats cheese. Eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/haloumi-fries/, Garlic dipping sauce – Mix ingredients in a bowl and set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the flavours develop. Cut the haloumi into fries around 1.5cm / 0/6" thick. The length will depend on the shape of your haloumi. I cut mine into 5 slices lengthwise; then each into half which makes uniform fries; and get 20 pieces. Dry – Pat halloumi mostly dry using tea towels. Prep – Using 3 bowls large enough to toss the halloumi; put the eggs in one bowl; mix Flour Dredge in another and mix Crumbing ingredients in a third. Crumb – Dip a haloumi fry in flour; shake off excess. Dip in egg; allow excess to drip off. Coat in breadcrumbs; pressing to adhere; then place on tray. PRO: Do 2 at a time. 🙌🏻 Toss haloumi in breadcrumbs (by tossing the bowl) so you don't have to touch. 🙌🏻 Heat oil in a medium sauce pan over high heat until it reaches 180°C/350°F (Note 4). Fry 5 haloumi sticks at a time for 1 1/2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel lined tray. Repeat with remaining haloumi. Air fry and baking – see Note 5. Serve hot with yoghurt garlic dipping sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/tuna-sandwich/, Filling – Put all the Tuna Filling ingredients in a bowl. Mix well using a wooden spoon; breaking up the tuna so the filling becomes fairly smooth. The pickles and celery will take a beating too which is encouraged -> flavour melding! Sandwich – Divide Tuna Filling between 4 sandwiches (or more/less depending on bread size). I butter the bread and use 2 pieces of lettuce per sandwich. Enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-caramel-ginger-chicken/, Toss chicken with fish sauce and chilli; then set aside while you prepare the other ingredients. You could marinate even overnight but it's not necessary. Pan size – Use a large non-stick pan (mine is 30cm/12"; must be large). Else; be prepared to remove chicken at end to speed up sauce reduction. See Note 4! Caramel – Mix oil and sugar in the cold pan; then turn onto medium high heat.  As soon as the sugar is melted; remove the pan from the stove then carefully add the chicken (⚠️ it will sizzle so don't throw it in!) . Add ginger and shallots; toss briefly. The caramel may harden; that's ok; it will re-melt. Cook outside of chicken – Then put the pan back on the stove and stir just until the chicken changes from pink to white all over; but not browned; and definitely not cooked through. Simmer 10 min – Add water; stir; bring to a simmer. Simmer very rapidly; still on medium high (or even high!); for 10 to 12 minutes; until the liquid reduces right down to a glaze. It might take longer if your pan is smaller or your stove is weaker; that's ok. Stir every now and then while watery; then once it's reduced down to a glaze; toss regularly to get nice colour on the chicken. The further you take it; the better the colour! Serve with jasmine rice or other plain rice garnished with extra slices of chilli and fresh coriander if desired. Smashed cucumbers or Asian Slaw would be a terrific side!
https://www.recipetineats.com/rocky-road-recipe/, Line a 20cm/8" square pan with baking paper (parchment paper). Melt chocolate – Place chocolate and oil in a bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments; stirring in between; until melted and smooth. Add-ins – Stir the Add-ins into the chocolate. Pour into pan; spreading out evenly. Refrigerate for 3 hours or until fully cool. Cut – Remove from the fridge 30 minutes prior to cutting. I cut into 5 lines; then into chunks for eating or larger pieces for gifting!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-asian-zucchini-recipe/, Toss the zucchini in oil then sprinkle with salt and toss to (roughly) coat all over. Cook – Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Place half the zucchini cut side down and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until the surface is golden. Turn and cook the skin side for 3 minutes. Pile onto a serving plate and repeat with remaining zucchini. Sauce – cool the pan slightly then return to medium heat. Heat the oil then sauté the garlic until light golden. Add remaining Sauce ingredients; simmer for 30 seconds until syrupy. Serve – Pour over zucchini; pile on Crispy Asian Shallots and green onion. Eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/lamb-tagine/, Preheat oven to 180°F/350°F (160°C fan). (Note 6 re: other cook methods) Spice mix – Mix the ingredients in a bowl then set aside. Brown lamb – Toss lamb with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large oven-proof dutch oven (with a lid) over high heat. Brown the lamb in 3 batches; turning to colour the pieces all over; about 3 minutes. Remove into a bowl; then repeat with remaining lamb. Set aside. Aromatics – Turn heat down to medium high. Add onion and garlic; cook for 3 minutes until soft. Add tomato paste; ginger; cinnamon and spice mix. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes; stirring constantly. Sauce – Add chicken stock and water; stir; then return the lamb into the pot. Slow cook 1 hr 45 min – Bring to a simmer; cover with a lid then cook in the oven for 45 minutes. Add apricots; put the lid back on and cook for another 1 hour; checking halfway to ensure the sauce hasn't reduced all the way (if you're concerned; add 1/2 cup water). Lemon finish – Lamb should be tender – check! Gently stir in lemon zest. Serve over plain couscous; sprinkled with almonds and coriander.
https://www.recipetineats.com/waffles-recipe/, Whisk dry – Place the flour; sugar; baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to mix. Whisk in wet – Add milk; eggs and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter then whisk until lump free. The batter should be pourable but thick – slightly thinner than pancakes. Recommended resting (Note 1) – Cover then refrigerate overnight; or for at least 2 hours. Softer insides; better flavour. Else; proceed immediately with cooking. Preheat a waffle maker (Note 2; inc setting options). A non stick one will not need oil; plus there is butter in the batter. Cooking – Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy – it will leak out the sides! Cook until golden and crisp – my good waffle iron takes 3 1/2 minutes; my Kmart one takes 6 minutes. Serving – Transfer onto plates and serve as you go; with desired toppings. Or; put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated 70°C/150°F oven while you continue cooking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/sweet-potato-steaks/, Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan-forced). Line a tray with parchment/baking paper. Bake sweet potato – Rub sweet potato steaks with oil; then sprinkle each side evenly with spice mix (don’t rub; it smears). Bake 45 – 50 minutes until potato is soft. Don’t flip. Tahini yogurt sauce – Whisk ingredients in a medium heat-proof bowl until mostly combined. Microwave for 20 seconds on high. Whisk again – it will be like softly whipped cream! Use warm or at room temp. Toast pine nuts in a small pan (no oil) preheated over medium heat. Once lightly golden; remove into a bowl. Topping – In the same pan; heat oil (still on medium). Add all Topping ingredients and cook; stirring; until the garlic is golden. Transfer into a bowl immediately. Assemble – Smear most of the yogurt sauce on plate (save some for drizzling). Put sweet potato on top. Sprinkle with Topping; drizzle with yogurt sauce; then sprinkle with pine nuts; coriander and sumac. EAT with crunchy toasted flatbread!
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-creamy-tomato-beef-pasta/, Sauté – Heat the oil on high heat in a large heavy-based pot. Cook garlic and onion for 1 1/2 minutes. Cook beef & seasonings – Add beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; until you can no longer see red meat. Add the Italian herbs and cook for 30 seconds; then add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute to cook out the raw flavour. All in – Add crushed tomato; chicken stock; salt; pepper and red pepper flakes; if using. Stir; then add the pasta. Cook 15 min – Bring the liquid to a simmer; then cook for 15 minutes; stirring every couple of minutes then more frequently towards the end (ensure pasta doesn't stick to base) until the pasta is just about cooked. Creamy – Add cream; then simmer for a further 1 to 2 minutes. It will still be quite saucy – this is what you want! Pasta absorbs liquid quickly; so it will still be nice and oozy when you start eating. Serve – Remove from the stove. Give it a good stir then ladle into bowls. Serve with parmesan and parsley.
https://www.recipetineats.com/apple-turnovers/, Filling – Put apples in a large saucepan. Toss with cornflour. Add everything else. Cook on medium to medium-high heat; stirring regularly; for 5 minutes. Apple should be softened but not mushy or losing shape; with some but not too much caramel. Cool – Spread the filling on a large plate then let it fully cool. (Note 5) Line a large cutting board or upside down tray with baking/parchment paper. Make turnovers – Working one puff pastry sheet at a time; barely thawed; cut into 4 squares (12.5cm/5"). Brush 2 sides with egg; then pile filling on the egg brushed side. Avoid using sauce; soaks base and if it leaks onto edge it will not seal. (Save leftover sauce & apple for pancakes; french toast; ice cream etc!) Wrap – Fold over; seal with fork dipped in flour (prevents sticking to pastry). Transfer to paper lined cutting board. Refrigerate for 20 minutes (cold = better puffing). Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Bake 25 min – Slide the paper with the turnovers on it onto a large baking tray. (Note 6 for why) Brush turnovers with egg. Stab 3 times. Bake 25 minutes or until golden. Serve warm; dusted with icing sugar and whipped cream for dunking. Transfer turnovers to a cooling rack. Fully cool. Split seam side open with knife. Pipe in cream.

https://www.recipetineats.com/how-i-cut-butternut/, Peel off the skin using a potato peeler. The skin is softer than pumpkin so it's easier. Cut in half using a sharp knife. Just straight through the middle; lying down. Use the weight of your body pressing down on the knife and/or rock the knife back and forth. Stand upright; then cut in half again. Scoop out the seeds using a spoon. Cut the cheeks off the side with the stem (too hard to cut through the stem). Then trim all the butternut flesh from around the hard stem. Cut – And finally; cut the butternut into the size you want! For Pumpkin Soup; you will want them in 3cm / 1.2" chunks.
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-rice/, No need to rinse the rice. The rice will be fluffy because this recipe uses the right ratio: 1.5 cups liquid for every 1 cup of rice. Sauté garlic – Melt half the butter in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Once foamy; add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until it turns light golden. Coat rice – Add the rice and stir for 30 seconds or until the grains turn translucent. Simmer – Add stock and salt. Turn heat up to high; then once the water starts bubbling; put the lid on and immediately turn the stove down to low (or medium low; if your stove is weak/small). (Note 5) Cook 15 minutes – Cook the rice for 15 minutes. No stirring; don't lift the lid. Rest 10 minutes – Tilt the saucepan and have a quick peek to ensure all the water is absorbed. Then remove off the stove; with the lid still on; and rest for 10 minutes. Fluff rice; then fluff through remaining butter until melted. Toss through parsley; then tumble into serving dish. Sprinkle with extra parsley then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/panang-curry/, Simmer – Peel and devein prawns; reserving heads and shells. Bring chicken stock to a simmer in a small pot on high heat. Add prawn heads & shells; bring back to a simmer; then reduce to low heat. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes; periodically crushing the heads lightly with a potato masher and skimming off any orange scum. Strain into a jug; discarding heads. You should have just over 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of stock. Leave undisturbed to let the sediment settle (~ 5min+). Cut chillies in half then tap / squeeze out seeds (use a chopstick if needed for stubborn seeds). Discard seeds (spicy!). Chop chilli. Soak dried chillis in 2 cups of boiling water for 30 minutes. Drain in a colander; reserve soaking liquid. Peanuts – Put peanuts in a tall jar that comfortably fits the head of a stick blender (or use a small blender). Cover the jar opening with your hand and pulse until finely ground. Blitz paste – Add drained chillis and remaining Curry Paste ingredients; along with 1/4 cup of the reserved chilli soaking liquid. Blend; scraping down the sides as you go; for about 30 seconds until smooth; using extra chilli water only if needed to help blend. Cook curry paste – Heat oil in a large deep frying pan over medium-low heat. Cook curry paste for 5 minutes; stirring constantly. The paste should be drier; darker; smelling aromatic and no longer raw. Sauce – Add 1 cup (250 ml) prawn stock; being careful to pour off just the clearer liquid and leaving the sediment behind. Stir in the coconut cream; sugar; fish sauce and salt. Mix in the green beans. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce thickens and the beans are half cooked. Add prawns; stir; then simmer for another 2 minutes until the prawns are cooked. Stir in the Thai basil leaves. The final taste should lean mostly savoury and sweet; and medium spiciness. Serve over jasmine rice garnished with chopped peanuts; chilli and more Thai basil leaves!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cobb-salad/, Dressing: Shake ingredients in a jar. Flavour chicken: Poach chicken using this method (20 minute foolproof-guaranteed-juicy). Cool to room temperature then cut into 2cm / 0.75” cubes. Toss with salt; pepper and 2 tablespoons of Dressing. Set aside. Crisp bacon: Place bacon strips in a non-stick pan (not heated; no oil). Turn heat onto medium high – as the pan heats up; the fat will begin to melt. Cook for 2 minutes until golden; turn and cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes until golden. Drain on paper towels. Once cool and crisp; chop into 1.5cm / 0.6" pieces. Assemble: Spread lettuce on a large platter. Arrange the ingredients on top in the Cobb Salad signature neat rows: egg; bacon; avocado; tomato and chicken. Crumble blue cheese across the top; sprinkle with chives. Pour dressing into a jug. Serving: Let everybody help themselves to the salad and Dressing!
https://www.recipetineats.com/arayes-lebanese-meat-stuffed-pita/, Grate the onion in a bowl using a standard box grater. We want the juices and all! (Note 4) Meat filling – Add remaining meat filling ingredients. Mix well with your hands. Divide stuffing in 10 (about 55 to 60g per portion; 1/4 cup). Flatten into a semi-circle shape slightly smaller than the pita bread half. Stuff – Gently open a pita then place the meat inside. Close; then press to spread to the edge and make it fairly evenly flat. (Is your pita tearing? See Note 5 for tip!) Preheat oven to 50C/120F. Place a rack on a tray. (To keep cooked Arayes warm.) Cook – Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. Spray both sides of the pita with olive oil then place 2 or 3 pieces in the pan (whatever you can fit). Cook for about 2 minutes on each side; pressing down lightly with a spatula; until golden and crispy. The meat is spread so thin it cooks really quickly! {Sandwich press – Note 7} Keep warm – Transfer cooked Arayes onto the rack and put in the oven to keep warm. Cook remaining pita. Serve – Cut in half if desired (sometimes I do; sometimes I don't!). Pile Arayes onto a serving platter. Serve with Whipped Tahini sauce. Enjoy! Place ingredients in a heatproof bowl and whisk to combine. Microwave for 15 seconds on high. Whisk again – it should resemble soft whipped cream. Use slightly warm or at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/grilled-cheese-sandwich/, Butter bread – Slather both sides of each piece of bread with the butter (yes; all 4 sides!). Light toast – Heat a heavy-based skillet or frying pan over medium low heat (no oil or butter). Place both pieces of bread in the skillet and lightly toast for 1 minute to warm it through and create a light crust. (When we flip; this gives the cheese a head start). Pile on cheese – Flip one slice of bread; then pile on the cheddar cheese followed by the mozzarella. Place the other slice of bread on top; with the hot toasted side in contact with the cheese. Cook 3 minutes – Cook for 3 minutes or until the bread is evenly golden and crisp; pressing down lightly with a spatula every now and then. If it's browning too quickly; remove remove from the stove to cool down a bit and lower heat. Flip; 3 minutes – Turn the sandwich over; and cook the other side for 3 minutes or until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted. Devour – Transfer to cutting board. Cut in half in one swift motion. Admire cheese pull. Devour.
https://www.recipetineats.com/japchae-korean-noodles/, Cut beef into strips that are ~ 5mm thick; 1cm wide and about 5cm long (1/5" x 2/5" x 2"). If using shortribs; trim excess fat; cut the meat off the bone. Then cut each piece in half lengthwise (to form 2 "steaks") then slice into 5mm thick. (See step photos in post or video at 0.11s; Note 6) Marinate – Put beef in a bowl. Add marinade ingredients; then mix. Set aside marinate while you proceed with recipe; ~15 – 20 minutes is all it needs. (Note 5) Sauce – Mix the Sauce ingredients in a very large mixing bowl. Noodles – Cook sweet potato noodles per packet directions (normally 8 min in boiling water). Drain; briefly rinse under tap water then shake off excess water well. Add noodles into the bowl with the dressing. DO NOT MIX. Batch 1 – Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick pan (30cm/12") over high heat. Cook the brown onion; white part of green onion and shiitake mushrooms with 1/2 tsp salt for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes; stirring constantly; just until starting to soften but not going golden. Pour on top of the noodles – don't mix yet! Batch 2 – Using the same pan still on high heat; heat 1 tbsp oil then cook the carrot and capsicum for 1 1/2 minutes; constantly stirring. Add spinach; green onion and the final 1/2 tsp salt. Keep cooking for 1 1/2 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Transfer into the noodle bowl – still don't mix! Cook beef – In the same pan; heat the final 1 tbsp of oil still on high heat. Add beef and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until very lightly golden and just cooked through. Add to the noodle bowl. Don't mix! Mix! Add most of the sesame seeds (reserve some for topping). NOW you can mix! Toss; toss; toss. Serve – Transfer into a serving bowl; sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds. This is meant to be eaten warm; not piping hot. Eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/golden-gaytime-popcorn-copycat/, Test oil – Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add a few pieces of popcorn and wait until it pops; then quickly remove. Pop – Add remaining popcorn; elevate off stove to shake and spread corn out evenly. Cover with a lid. Once the popcorn starts popping in earnest; shake the pot gently once. Then crack the lid a tiny bit – let's steam escape for crisper popcorn. Remove from heat when the popping stops (when you can count to 3 between pops) and transfer to a (very!) large bowl. Preheat oven to 110°C/230°F (both fan and standard ovens). Combine – Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar; corn syrup and salt. Stir until just combined. Simmer – When it starts to bubble; simmer for 4 minutes – DO NOT STIR! Baking soda "foamy" – Remove from heat then quickly whisk in caramel (toffee or vanilla) and baking soda. When you stop whisking; the caramel will foam and increase in volume. Coat popcorn – Quickly pour straight over popcorn; toss until caramel cools and starts to harden. Spread popcorn on 2 large paper lined baking trays. Bake for 45 minutes; tossing every 10 minutes or so. Caramel will remelt for the first 2-3 tosses – tossing coats popcorn more evenly with caramel. (If using glucose; bake further 15 minutes). Cool – Remove from oven; leave to cool on the tray for 20 minutes. Then break up the popcorn – no need to be too pedantic; clumps are great! Crumbs – Place biscuits in a ziplock bag and bash into crumbs.  Melt chocolate – Place chocolate in a heatproof bowl and microwave in 30 second increments on high; stirring in between; until melted and smooth – about 1 1/2 minutes. (If doing a small amount of white chocolate; reduce to 20 second increments). Piping bags – Transfer chocolate into a piping bag. Use scissors to snip a small opening at the tip. (Alternative: just drizzle with a spoon). Drizzle & crumb – Push the popcorn together but in a single layer. Drizzle criss-cross (or any pattern!) all over the popcorn. Sprinkle with biscuits crumbs while the chocolate is wet so it sticks. Fridge – Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the chocolate is firm. Gently break popcorn into pieces. EAT! Store in an airtight container in a cool place. Stays crisp for at least a week. Our test batches never lasted any longer!
https://www.recipetineats.com/tomato-burrata-salad/, De-chill – Take the burrata out of the fridge and leave on the counter for 30 minutes; to take the fridge-chill out of it. Keep it in the water in the tub. Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Roast 10 min – Toss the cherry tomatoes with the olive oil; eschalot; salt and pepper (in a bowl; or on a tray). Spread on a tray. Roast 10 minutes until softened but not collapsing. Vinegar – Gently push the tomatoes to one end of the tray. Drizzle over vinegar. No need to mix. Tomatoes – Carefully transfer tomatoes to a plate; spreading them out in a single layer. Burrata – Gently (GENTLY!!) drain the water out of the tub and roll the burrata out into your hand. Place a burrata on top of tomatoes. Finish – Drizzle the 1 tablespoon of good extra virgin olive oil all over the plate. Dollop pesto randomly all over. Sprinkle with salt flakes and basil. Serve with crusty bread on the side! Eating! Nominate a person to do the cutting honours. Break into the burrata with a serving spoon. Let the centre ooze out. Make sure you scoop up a bit of everything; pile onto bread and eat! Don't forget to mop the plate clean. The juices are the best part.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sizzling-ginger-steamed-fish/, Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Prepare parcel – Place a 2 x 25cm / 10" piece of foil on a work surface. Top with a piece of parchment/baking paper slightly smaller. Place fish on paper. Season fish & wrap – Sprinkle each side of the fish with a SMALL pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle the top of each fish with 1/2 tsp sake. Form a parcel – make a parcel with the paper first; then the foil. (See video or step photos). Bake – Place parcels on a tray. Bake for 12 minutes or until the internal temperature is 55°C/130°F (I pierce thermometer through foil) or the fish flesh flakes (open to check). Thin fish cooks fast when enclosed! Rest 3 min – Put each parcel on a plate and unwrap; folding down the sides to create a “boat” that will catch the sauce that you can squidge the fish in. Rest for 3 minutes – heat the oil while it rests. Heat oil until hot in a tiny saucepan or small pan over medium heat. Sizzle! Top the fish with green onion; ginger and chilli. Drizzle with soy and sesame oil. Pour oil all over the green onion and ginger – it will sizzle dramatically! Serve immediately. Eat fish out of foil; squidging the flaky pieces well in the sauce before eating. See post for what I served it with!
https://www.recipetineats.com/hot-chocolate-fudge-cake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Grease a 20cm/8" cake pan with butter then line with paper. Whisk Dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add Wet – Then add all the Wet ingredients EXCEPT the boiling water. Whisk until combined. Then add the boiling water and whisk until smooth. The batter will be pretty thin. Bake 40 min – Pour into the pan. Bake for 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out mostly clean – a faint smear of batter isn't a bad thing; we're making a fudge cake here! Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a plate; then onto a cooling rack or plate right side up. Cool for a further 10 minutes – the cake will still be warm for serving. Serving – Cut slices of the warm cake. Top with a scoop of ice cream. Douse with fudge sauce – just shy of 1/4 cup per slice (10 slices). Eat and swoon! Heat cream until hot; just before boiling point; using your method of choice – saucepan or microwave. Stand 5 min – Put chocolate in bowl. Pour over hot cream. Ensure all chocolate is submerged; then cover with a plate. Leave for 5 minutes. Mix – Using a whisk or rubber spatula; mix vigorously until the cream and chocolate combine into a silky chocolate sauce. Cool to thicken for 20 minutes. Give it a stir then pour into a jug for serving!
https://www.recipetineats.com/balsamic-marinated-mushrooms/, Preheat oven to 200°C/375°F (180°C fan). Season – Put mushrooms into a roasting pan (not tray; easier to mix well in pan). They can be snug but should be in a single layer (mushrooms shrink ~25-30%). Toss with olive oil first. Then add salt; pepper; thyme and garlic (minced & whole); then toss again. Roast 35 minutes; tossing well at the 20 minute mark; or until the mushrooms are browned and soft. Marinade – While hot; transfer mushrooms into a bowl (including all the juices). Add balsamic and olive oil. Toss well. Marinate 2 to 24 hrs – Let the mushrooms cool and marinate for 2 hours (uncovered); tossing once or twice; or for even better flavour; marinate overnight (covered in fridge once cool).  Serving – Always serve at room temperature or slightly warmed; for best flavour. And don't waste the juices – it's full of flavour! Serving options – As part of a grazing board; on polenta or mash as a meal; on toast slathered with goats cheese or cream cheese; on the side of fried eggs; on creamy risotto or risoni/orzo. See in post for a long list!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-tuscan-chicken-soup/, Cook outside of chicken – Sprinkle each side with the salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Once foamy; place the chicken in and cook the first side for 3 minutes or until light golden; then the other side for 2 minutes – it's fine if the inside is still raw; it cooks more later. Remove onto a plate. Soup flavour base – Turn the stove down to medium low. Add garlic; onion and celery into the same pot then cook for 3 minutes or until the onion is softened. Deglaze – Turn up to high; add wine; stir; then let it simmer until the wine reduces by half. Broth & pasta – Add stock/broth; water; salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then add the pasta. Cook for the time per the pasta packet directions (~10 minutes); stirring every now and then so the pasta doesn't stick to the base of the pot. Add chicken partway – While the pasta is cooking; chop the chicken into 1.5cm / 1/2" pieces then add into the pot to finish cooking. Finish soup – Once the pasta is cooked; turn heat down to low. Stir in parmesan until melted. Stir in the cornflour-water mixture; cream and spinach. Stir for a minute until spinach is wilted and soup thickens slightly. Serve – Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with sun dried tomato strips (and a bit of oil looks nice for finishing). Eat! Storing – Separate pasta from soup so it doesn't bloat; refrigerate both. Just scoop out with slotted spoon. (Note 6)
https://www.recipetineats.com/rhubarb-crumble/, Preheat oven to 200°C/375°F (180°C fan). Filling: Place rhubarb; apple; sugar and orange zest in a large mixing bowl and toss well. Spread evenly in a 30 x 20cm baking dish (12 x 8") (Note 3) Crumble topping: Place topping ingredients in a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until all the flour is incorporated (use cutting motion/ smearing up wall; as needed). It will be a sandy mixture. Scrunch & top: Grab handfuls of crumble and enclose your fist to press into lumps. Break into clumps and scatter over the filling. (Note 4 explains this unusual step!). Bake for 35 minutes or until rhubarb is soft and the crumble is golden brown. (Bake time – Note 5) Rest & serve: Remove from the oven; rest for 5 minutes. Scoop into bowls and serve with vanilla ice cream or custard!
https://www.recipetineats.com/italian-orzo-salad-risoni/, Cook pasta – Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add salt and risoni/orzo; then cook per packet directions (usually ~10 minutes). Drain in colander; rinse; shake off excess water well. Transfer to large bowl. Toss with the olive oil then let cool. Dressing – Shake in a jar. Crispy salami – Put salami in cold large non-stick pan; with no oil. Turn onto medium high – as the pan heats up; the fat will melt so it cooks in its own fat. Cook for 3 – 5 minutes; stirring regularly; until light golden. Drain on paper towels. It will crisp as it cools. Toss – Set aside 1/3 of the salami for topping. Put all remaining salad ingredients in with the risoni. Toss. Pour over dressing. Toss; toss; toss!  Serve! Tumble into serving bowl. Sprinkle with remaining salami. Divide between bowls. Eat with spoon! Best eaten at room temp; not fridge cold (can taste flavours better).
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-chow-mein-noodles/, Sauce – Mix ingredients in a small bowl then set aside. Some is used to flavour the beef; then the rest for the noodles. Sauce thickener (cornflour slurry) – Mix the cornflour / cornstarch and water in a separate small bowl. Prepare noodles per packet directions then drain. Cook beef – Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat. Cook garlic for 10 seconds; then add the beef and cook until you can no longer see pink. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Sauce and the white part of the green onions. Cook for another 2 minutes to get the beef nicely caramelised. Finish sauce – Mix the cornflour slurry into the remaining sauce. Egg – Add the egg into the pan then mix it through the beef; it will sort of scramble. Egg makes the beef stick to the noodles better! Cabbage & carrot – When the egg is mostly cooked; add the carrot and cabbage. Cook for 1 minute until cabbage starts to wilt. Sauce & noodles – Give the sauce a quick mix. Add the bean sprouts; noodles and sauce into the pan. Toss well for 1 minute or until sauce is dispersed through the noodles. Add green part of green onions. Toss for another 1 minute. Serve – Divide between bowls and serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-tuna-crispy-rice-nobu/, Start the rice the day before or first thing in the morning – it needs minimum 4 hours to chill. Make the toppings first; then refrigerate while you cook the crispy rice cakes. Cook the crispy rice cakes and sprinkle with salt per the recipe. Assemble – Place rice cakes on a serving platter. Pile on toppings – I use teaspoons to make football shapes then slide on. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds; top with jalapeño. Eat! Freeze to firm – Place tuna in the freezer for 30 minutes to partially freeze – it's much easier to finely chop when slightly firm. Cut into 0.5cm / 1/2" cubes – the smaller the better! Place into a bowl and let it de-chill for 20 minutes (not as nice ice-cold). Mix – Add everything into the tuna and mix until combined. Place tuna in a bowl and use a fork to mash it up really finely. Add everything else and mix well. 
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-rice/, Cook rice; rest; pour over seasoning; fluff. Press firmly into 20cm/8" lined pan; weigh down. Cool; fridge overnight (min 6 hrs). Cut into 15 rectangles; pan fry 4 min each side; sprinkle with salt. Sushi seasoning – Mix together until sugar dissolves. Cook rice (Note 4) – Place rice and water in a small pot (no lid) over medium high heat. Once it's bubbling on the edges and the middle is rippling; put the lid on and turn down to medium low (or low for strong stoves). Cook for 13 minutes or until water is absorbed. Rest – Remove from heat then rest for 10 minutes with the lid still on. Season – Remove lid. Pour over sushi seasoning. Fluff rice with rubber spatula. Press – Place a sheet of baking/parchment paper on a 20cm/8" square pan. Scrape hot rice into the pan and spread evenly. Cover with another piece of paper and press in very firmly. Weigh down (recommended; Note 5) – For best results; place something flat on top (2nd same size pan is ideal) then weigh down with 5 x 400g/14oz cans. Cool – Fully cool; cover with cling wrap; then refrigerate overnight (min 6 hours). Speedy option: Fridge uncovered until fully cool; cover; freeze 1 hour; fridge 1 hour. Cut – Lift rice out using paper overhang. Wet the knife blade (neater cuts). Cut rice into 15 rectangles (5 strips; then each into 3). Pan fry – Heat about 1/4 cup of the oil in a large non-stick pan over medium high. Place in half the rice cakes – they should sizzle gently. Lower heat to medium. Cook for 4 minutes until really golden and crispy. Turn and cook the other side for 4 minutes. Salt – Remove onto a paper towels lined plate. Sprinkle each side with salt while hot. Keep cooking – Add remaining oil and cook remaining rice cakes. Serve as snack (you won't be able to stop!) or a base for canapés. Topping suggestions – Spicy tuna (Nobu copycat); tuna poke; salmon mousse; crostini toppings.
https://www.recipetineats.com/herb-garlic-chicken-marylands/, Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Mix Herb & Garlic Butter ingredients until combined. Butter chicken – Use an upside down tablespoon to loosen the chicken skin from the flesh on the thigh and most of the leg (Note 4). Smear 80% of the butter under the skin; just a small amount (~5%) on the underside (flesh side) then the remainder on top of the skin. (The flesh side gets lots of flavour from the pan juices). Put chicken in roasting pan; skin side up. Sprinkle skin with the 1/2 tsp salt. Pour wine around chicken. Roast 50 minutes – Roast 10 minutes to get the skin going. Then reduce the heat to 200°C /400°F (180°C fan) and roast for a further 40 minutes; basting every 10 minutes from the 20 minute mark onwards. Rest & serve – Remove from oven. Rest 10 minutes then serve with the garlic-herb-butter pan juices as the sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/potato-salad/, French Dressing – Shake ingredients in a jar until well combined. Cook potatoes (CAREFUL! Note 5) – Put potatoes and 2 teaspoon salt in a large pot of cold water. Turn the stove on. Once the water is simmering; cook for 4 minutes or until the potatoes are JUST cooked (still bit firm in the middle) – they will keep cooking with residual heat. Drain immediately (gently!). Douse hot potatoes! Carefully transfer potatoes into a large bowl and pour over French Dressing. Gently toss to coat then set aside for 2 hours so potatoes absorb the dressing and cool (less fragile).  Crispy bacon – Lay half the bacon in a cold non-stick pan. Turn onto medium high and cook until golden (the fat will melt as the pan warms up so it cooks in its own fat). Turn and cook the other side until golden. Drain paper towels; repeat with remaining bacon. Once cool and crisp; chop into small pieces.  Creamy Dressing – Mix ingredients in a bowl until combined. Toss – Add creamy dressing; celery; cucumber; onion; and most of the bacon. Toss gently to combine.  Serving – Serve garnished with remaining bacon. If time permits; I recommend setting aside for a few hours; or even better; overnight; to give the flavours a chance to meld. But still amazing served straight away! Always serve at room temperature; not fridge cold.
https://www.recipetineats.com/affogato/, Put ice cream in glass suitable for affogato eating (Note 4).  Place shot of espresso and liquor (if using) on the side. Pour the hot espresso then liquor over the ice cream. Enjoy swirls of melty ice cream blending into the coffee. Dig in immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/hungarian-goulash-recipe/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan); though you can use your slow cooker or stove instead (oven easiest! Note 4). Season beef – Toss the beef with half the salt and pepper. Cook onion – Heat the oil and melt the butter in a large oven-proof dutch oven over high heat. Cook onion for 6 minutes until the edges are light golden. Cook beef – Add the beef and stir until the outside changes from red to brown; about 2 minutes. It won't go golden brown; it's not supposed to. Add vegetables – Add garlic; capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes – the tomato will mostly breakdown. Add paprika; caraway and bay leaf. Stir for 30 seconds. Slow cook – Add beef stock; stir; bring to simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Add potato – The beef should be pretty tender but not quite "fall-apart". Stir in carrot and potatoes. Return to oven; covered; for another 30 minutes. Beef should now be "fall-apart" – if not; return to the oven for 10 minutes at a time. Serve – Ladle goulash into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Eat as is; with optional bread for dunking! (Pictured with cheese bread)
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-asian-cucumber-salad/, Smash – Hit cucumbers with a meat mallet; rolling pin or similar to make the sides burst open. Cut in half lengthwise then into 2.5cm/1" pieces. Salt 30 min – Place in a bowl; toss with salt. Set aside for 30 minutes to draw out water (Note 5). Drain/strain and discard salty water; leave cucumbers in same bowl. Whisk Dressing in a bowl. CHECK spiciness of your chilli crisp – they vary by brand. If using Laoganma; stick with recipe; else adjust to taste. Toss – Put green onion; eschalots; sesame seeds; dressing and chilli crisp in with the cucumbers. Toss until eschalots go floppy – ~30 seconds. Serve; sprinkled with extra sesame seeds and dollops of chilli crisp if you dare! Note: Water continues to come out of cucumbers so after few hours/next day; you'll have a lot more dressing but not as intense flavoured. So eat/serve with spoon to get plenty of dressing in every bite!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-bread/, Mix dry ingredients; mix in water. Rise 2 – 3 hrs until doubled.  Preheat pot 240°C/450°F (220°C fan). Turn dough out. Reserve 1/3 cheese for topping. Fold inwards 4 times; stuffed/layered with remaining cheese. Flip onto parchment paper. Pile reserved cheese on top. Bake 35 minutes covered; 10 minutes uncovered. Rest 10 minutes. Eat! Shaggy dough – Using a rubber spatula; mix flour; salt and yeast in a large bowl. Add water; then mix using the handle of the spatula until you can no longer see flour. The dough should be too sticky to knead by hand; but not pourable like cake batter (see video at X seconds). Rise – Cover with cling wrap and leave to rise in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours until the dough doubles in volume (Note 5). The surface should be bubbly; and the mixture should jiggle when you shake the bowl. Preheat pot – Half an hour before the dough is ready; put a 24-28cm / 4.5-8 quart heavy based pot with a lid in the oven to preheat to 240°C/450°F (220°C fan-forced). Note 7 for no dutch oven method. Pat into disc – Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour. Scrape dough out; sprinkle surface with flour; pat into a ~20cm/8" disc. Cheese it – Set aside 1/3 of the cheese for topping. Cover surface with half the remaining cheese. Fold inwards stuffed with cheese – Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server; large knife; spatula); fold the sides inwards 4 times to roughly form a roundish shape; topping each layer of with the remaining cheese (but keep the final layer cheese free; it will be the base of the bread). (Note 6 for tips) Paper transfer – Flip the dough onto a sheet of parchment/baking paper so the seamside is (mostly) facedown. Tidy the shape if desired. (Note 6) Cheese crown – Pile the reserved cheese on. Hot pot transfer – Remove hot pot from the oven. Use paper to transfer dough into the pot; keeping it on the paper. Put lid on. Bake 35 minutes. Remove lid. Bake 10 minutes to colour the surface. Cool – Remove pot from oven. Use paper to transfer bread onto a cooling rack. Remove paper. Cool at least 10 minutes before slicing! (Note 8)
https://www.recipetineats.com/corn-ribs/, Cut corn – Using a sharp knife and a non-slip cutting board; cut off the base and the pointy end of the corn. Stand the corn upright then cut the corn into half then half again to make quarters. My way: Bang the knife with your hand to lock it into the top of the corn; then keep hitting the knife to move it down the corn. Halfway; you might be able to stop banging and just rock the knife down. Easiest method – Cut half length ribs. Shorter ribs = easier to cut. See note 2. BBQ (best!) or oven – Heat BBQ on high or oven 200°C/375°F (180°C fan). Garlic butter – Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Then add the garlic and cook for 20 seconds until it smells amazing! Remove from the stove and keep warm/liquid (I usually put it on the side of the BBQ). Seasoning – mix in a small bowl. Season corn – Place corn in a large bowl. Toss with olive oil. Then sprinkle the seasoning over gradually; tossing in between; to coat as evenly as possible. Most will get stuck in the cob – tasty "bone" sucking! BBQ – Place corn on the BBQ kernel side down. Cook for 8 minutes or until you get charred spots – watch it curl into "ribs"! Then cook each cut side for 1 minute. Oven – Bake for 25 to 30 minutes; kernel side up. (Note: the corn doesn't curl as much; also; no charred spots). Butter it – Transfer corn back into the bowl. Pour over garlic butter and toss. Serve – Pile onto plate; sprinkle with parsley then grab and eat like ribs! Optional pink sauce pictured in notes. Don't forget to suck all the seasoned garlic butter from the cob "bone" – it might be the best part. 🙂
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-marsala/, Pound – Cut each breast in half to form 2 thin steaks. Cover with a freezer bag or Go-Between (Note 5) and pound to 1 cm / 0.4″ thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. This tenderises and ensures even cooking of the chicken. Dust – Sprinkle the surface with half the salt; pepper then flour. Lightly rub flour across surface; turn and repeat with remaining salt; pepper and flour. Shake excess flour off each piece just before cooking. Cook – Put half the butter and oil in a large non-stick pan over medium high heat. Once the butter is melted and foamy; place chicken in; then cook for 3 to 4 minutes until it's gorgeously golden and crispy. Turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes. Remove onto a plate. Sauté aromatics – In the same pan; add remaining butter and oil. Once butter is melted; add eschalots and garlic. Cook for 1 minute. Cook mushrooms – Add mushrooms. Cook for 3 minutes; stirring regularly. Reduce marsala – Add marsala; turn up heat to high and boil for 3 minutes or until reduced by half. Thicken sauce – Add chicken stock; cream; salt and pepper. Stir; then lower heat so it's simmering (not boiling rapidly) and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes until the sauce thickens to a cream consistency (not too thick; will thicken more). Rewarm chicken – Nestle chicken into sauce and leave for 30 seconds to reheat. Serve! Take off the stove. Sprinkle with parsley; serve over starchy vehicle of choice (I chose mash. Rice; small pasta; polenta or bread for plate mopping also work well!).

https://www.recipetineats.com/chilli-crisp-noodles/, CHECK the spiciness of your chilli crisp – taste it!! Laoganma is not actually that spicy (most store bought brands I've used are similar) and the quantity used is based on that brand. If yours is very spicy; start with less and add more later. Base sauce – Mix the sesame oil; vinegar; soy; sugar; salt and sesame paste in a bowl. Top with green onion (don’t mix in). Sizzling chili crisp – Heat chilli crisp and oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add ginger and garlic; stir 30 seconds until golden and it smells amazing. Pour over green onion – enjoy the sizzle!

Toss through coriander/cilantro. Adjust & finish –  Taste. Add more salt if needed and more chilli crisp if desired (not all chilli crisp is the same saltiness / spiciness). Eat!
https://www.recipetineats.com/ham-and-cheese-omelette/, Heat control – If at any stage your omelette is cooking too fast; remove the pan off the stove to let it cool down and lower the heat. Whisk the eggs; salt and cream in a bowl for 10 seconds until slightly foamy. Warm ham – Melt 1/3 of the butter in a 24cm/9.5" non-stick pan (or thereabouts; Note 5) over medium heat until foamy. Swirl/spread to coat the base; then cook ham using a rubber spatula for 90 seconds until warmed through. Remove into bowl. Semi-scramble eggs – Melt and swirl remaining butter in the pan. Give the eggs a quick whisk then pour into the pan. Leave for 15 seconds or until the very edges set; then do long leisurely strokes around and across the pan to scrape up cooked egg and let the raw egg run onto the base. Continue for 30 seconds or so until the egg is partially cooked. GOAL: wet enough to spread like jam; but not so wet that the egg runs when you tilt the pan. Spread the egg evenly across the pan (no need to be meticulous). Top half with cheese; then ham. (By this time; the omelette should be almost cooked through but still shiny/custardy on the surface). Loosen the naked side then fold over using 2 rubber spatulas. Leave in the pan for another 30 seconds to melt the cheese and finish cooking inside. Serve – Slide or flip onto a plate and serve! Sprinkle with chives if desired.

https://www.recipetineats.com/fluffy-ricotta-pancakes/, Whisk wet – Place the Wet ingredients in a bowl and whisk vigorously to combine. You should have little ricotta curd bits in it; but you don't want giant ricotta clumps. Add dry – Scatter the Dry ingredients across the surface then whisk until combined. The batter is a little thicker than standard pancake batter. Lightly butter pan – Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat until hot (I use 2 pans). Brush lightly with melted butter (or melt a bit then wipe off excess with paper towels – Note 4).  Batter – Pour in 1/4 cup batter – it should just about spread evenly into a round but may need a bit of coaxing. (I use an ice cream scoop – Note 5) Cook 3 minutes – Cook the first side for 1 1/2 minutes or until golden brown (turn heat down if browning too fast). Flip then cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes or until golden. Remove onto a plate. Cook remaining – If your non-stick coating is good; you won't need more butter though a very light brush of melted butter every 2nd or 3rd pancake won't hurt. Continue cooking; lowering the heat as you go as the pan gets hotter. You should get 9 to 10 in total. Keep cooked pancakes stacked so they keep each other warm (or use a low 50C/125F oven). Serve ricotta pancakes with macerated strawberries (below); softened butter and copious amounts of maple syrup! Toss together strawberries and sugar in a small bowl. Set aside for 20 minutes to allow them to sweat and soften slightly. (Even overnight in fridge is fine.) Serve on pancakes!

Drain; rinse briefly under tap water; then set aside to cool while making the sauce. Season chicken – Toss together Seasoned Chicken ingredients in a bowl. Crisp bacon – Put bacon in an unheated very large non-stick pan (Note 2). Turn stove on medium high. The fat will melt so the bacon cooks in its own fat.

Stir in the curry powder and turmeric; and then the rice. Toss the rice in the spiced butter until well coated and uniformly yellow. Pour over the reserved 1/2 cup of fish poaching stock; and toss to mix through (it moistens the rice). Season with salt if required – Check the rice for seasoning. If you used store-bought packet stock; you should find there's enough natural saltiness already. Otherwise season to taste and mix rice well. Peas & fish – Stir through the peas and most of the coriander (hold some back for garnish). Then gently fold through the fish; taking care to keep some pieces in large chunks. Serve – Spoon out rice onto one large platter or individual plates to serve. Top with boiled egg halves; and garnish with the remaining coriander. EAT!

Brown butter – Melt butter in a small silver pan or saucepan over medium heat (Note 2). Leave to simmer on medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes; stirring every now and then; until (when you push foam aside) you see little golden-brown bits. Immediately pour the butter and all the brown bits into a large mixing bowl (large enough to mix the cookie dough) and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Chop choc – Cut the chocolate into 1cm /1/4" pieces. Transfer the chunks into a bowl and leave the fine chocolate dust behind for another purpose (makes cookies speckled; Note 1). Mix dry ingredients – Whisk flour; oats; baking soda; and salt in a large bowl.  Back to the butter – Add sugar to the brown butter and whisk (it might not combine fully).

https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-lemongrass-pork-steaks/, Cut pork – Cut into 8 equal; thinnish slices of pork. I find it easiest using the knife on a 45° angle; but if you have the right shape piece you can just cut straight down. Pound each steak to 5mm / 0.2" thickness using the scary side of a meat mallet (jagged; not flat); using go-between (Note 5) or a freezer bag to avoid damaging the meat. (You can use baking paper for rolling pin or the flat side of the mallet.) Marinade – Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl; it will fizz when the baking soda is added! Add pork then toss well to coat using tongs. Transfer to a ziplock bag and marinate for 24 hours. Remove pork from the marinade and brush off the lemongrass pieces. Discard marinade – it's done its job! Cook – Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat until you see wisps of smoke. Add 1 1/2 tbsp oil; then cook half the pork for 1 1/2 minutes on one side and 1 minute on the other side until nicely charred. Remove onto a plate. Scrape pan clean of loose black bits then cook the remaining pork. Serve! Make Pork Noodle Bowls (bun thit nuong) or serve with rice and a side salad – see note 6 and in post for suggestions! NOTE – The thin pork steaks are beyond well done in 2 1/2 minutes but it doesn't matter because the baking soda keeps them tender. It will be blushing pink inside due to the baking soda (same happens with beef). You could cook them for another 5 minutes and they will still be tender inside. Miracle!
https://www.recipetineats.com/sweet-potato-soup/, Sauté aromatics – Heat the oil and melt the butter in a large heavy based pot over medium heat.

Bring to a simmer; then cook for 20 minutes at a gentle simmer until the sweet potato is very tender (no lid). Blitz – Remove the pot from the stove. Blitz with a hand-held stick until smooth. (Note 4 for blender) Stir in cream. Garnish – Ladle into bowls. Drizzle with yogurt; cream or olive oil with a sprinkle of something crunchy – pictured with pistachios and crispy flatbread strips (Note 3).
https://www.recipetineats.com/hot-cross-buns-recipe/, Mix dry – Place flour; yeast; sugar; all spice; cinnamon; and salt in a large bowl. Briefly mix with stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Add wet – Add butter; milk; egg; sultanas and zest. Standmixer: Mix for 5 minutes until a smooth elastic dough forms. Start on speed 2 then once the ingredients are combined; increase to speed 4. After 1 minute; add extra flour if required; just enough so dough comes away from side of bowl when mixing and doesn't stick terribly to your fingers. (Note 5).  Hand kneading: Alternatively; dust a work surface with flour and knead by hand for 10 minutes. Dough is kneaded enough when it's smooth and does not break when stretched – see photos & video for before/after comparison. Leave dough in the bowl; cover with cling wrap and place in a warm; wind free place to rise until doubled in size. This will take anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours depending on how warm it is – see Note 6. Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang. Remove cling wrap and punch dough to deflate. Dust work surface with flour; place dough on work surface; shape into a log – this will deflate the air. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Take one piece and press down with palm; then use your fingers to gather into a ball; then roll the dough briefly to form a ball. This stretches the dough on one side and that’s how I get a nice smooth surface. Place the ball with the smooth side up on the tray. Repeat with remaining dough. Line them up 3 x 4. Spray a piece of cling wrap lightly with oil (any); then loosely place over the tray. Return tray to warm place and leaver 30 – 45 minutes; until the dough has risen by about 75% (less than double in size). Partway through Rise #2; preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Mix flour and water until a thick runny paste forms – see video for thickness required. Spoon into a round 3 mm piping bag or small ziplock bag then snip corner. Remove the cling wrap and pipe crosses onto the buns. Go slow so it hugs the curves. Bake in preheated oven (180°C/350°F) for 22 minutes; or until the surface is a deep golden brown. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe. Meanwhile; place jam and water in a bowl; microwave for 30 seconds. Mix to combine. Remove buns from oven. Use overhang to lift buns onto a cooling rack.  Brush with jam mixture while warm. Allow to cool to warm before serving. Place the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a medium bowl; then pour in water. Leave for 5 minutes until it froths. Place flour; remaining sugar; salt and spices in a bowl. Whisk to combine. Make a well in the centre. Add remaining Buns ingredients and pour in the yeast liquid; including all froth. Mix until combined with wooden spoon – it will be like a thick muffin batter. Not pourable; but thick and sticky. Leave dough in the bowl; cover with a wet (clean) tea towel and place in a warm place to rise for around 1 1/2 – 2 hours. See Note 5 for how I do this (you will laugh – but it works every time!). The dough will triple in size and be bubbly on the surface. Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang. Remove tea towel and punch dough to deflate. Dust work surface with flour; place dough on work surface. Dust top of dough then knead lightly (to deflating air) and shape into a log. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Take one piece and press down with palm; then use your fingers to gather into a ball; then roll the dough briefly to form a ball. This stretches the dough on one side and that’s how I get a nice smooth surface. Place the ball with the smooth side up on the tray. Repeat with remaining dough. Line them up 3 x 4. Spray a piece of cling wrap lightly with oil (any); then place over the tray. Return tray to warm place and leave for 45 min – 1 hour; until the dough has risen by about 75% (less than double in size). Partway through Rise #2; preheat oven to 180C/350F (all oven types). Mix flour and water until a runny paste forms – see video for thickness required. Spoon into a round 3 mm piping bag or small ziplock bag then snip corner. Remove the cling wrap and pipe crosses onto the buns. Go slow so it hugs the curves. Bake for 22 minutes; or until the surface is a deep golden brown. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe. Meanwhile; place jam and water in a bowl; microwave for 30 seconds. Mix to combine. Remove buns from oven. Brush with jam mixture while warm. Use overhang to lift buns onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool to warm before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheesecake-stuffed-carrot-bundt-cake/, Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Grease a 12-cup (3 litre) Bundt pan (Note 6) with butter; then dust well with cocoa; shaking out excess. (Why cocoa? See Note 2) Prep pineapple – Drain pineapple in a colander; pressing out excess juice and reserving. Set pineapple and juice aside. Cheesecake filling – Using an electric beater; beat the cream cheese; sour cream; sugar; lemon and vanilla just until smooth. Beat in flour; just until incorporated. Beat in egg until mixed in. Transfer cheesecake mix into a piping bag and refrigerate until required. Batter – Whisk together the flour; baking soda; salt; and cinnamon in a large bowl. Set aside. In a separate bowl; combine the milk; vinegar; eggs; brown sugar; canola oil; and   ¼ cup of the reserved pineapple juice. Whisk until smooth; then stir in the crushed pineapple; shredded carrot; coconut flakes; and walnuts; if using. Pour this over the flour mixture and gently stir until combined. Assemble – Pour about 2 1/2 cups of batter into the Bundt pan. Cut a 1.8cm / 3/4" hole in the end of the piping bag. Pipe a ring of the filling directly on top of the batter—avoid touching sides of pan. Cover with remaining batter. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove; cover loosely with foil and bake for another 30 minutes. Check with a skewer to ensure it's cooked (straight down into cheesecake; and also on the inner wall of the ring) Glaze – Cool 20 minutes in the pan. Invert on to a rack and allow to fully cool. Spoon the glaze on top; allowing it to drip down the sides of the cake. Sprinkle with walnuts; if using. Cut with a hot knife (for neater slices) and serve! Beat butter; cream cheese; and vanilla until smooth. Beat in icing sugar in two batches; starting on a low speed first (to avoid powder storm!). Adjust thickness – Beat in milk and lemon juice. Add extra milk 1 teaspoon at a time until it becomes a thick glaze – BE CAREFUL; it will go from too thick to too thin with just a tiny bit of milk! GOAL: a glaze you can spoon onto the cake; so it oozes thickly down the sides; rather than being thin and transparent like most glazes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-koftas/, Fish & egg blitz – Place fish and egg white in a food processor. Blitz on high until smooth. (30 sec to 1 minute) A stick blender also works but it will take a bit longer. Kofta mixture – Add onion; garlic; all the spices; salt; rice flour and parsley. Blitz on high until smooth (1 minute). Consistency should be like a paste. (Note Feta – Remove the blade; then crumble the feta in. Aim for chunks. Mix delicately (so the feta doesn't disintegrate). Form koftas – Use wet hands so the mixture doesn't stick. Portion the mixture into 10 – 12 (70g / 1/3 cup each); and shape into a 10cm / 4" cylinder. Thread onto skewers then slightly flatten to 1.75cm / 2/3" thick. (Note 3) Cook – Heat olive oil over medium high heat in a large non-stick pan. Cook half the koftas for 2 minutes on each side until golden; or until the internal temperature reaches 50°C/122°F. Rest – Remove onto a plate and cook the remaining koftas. (Internal temperature of cooked koftas will rise to 55°C/131°F). Serve with Minted Yogurt and Jewelled rice pilaf for a stunning platter of food! Blitz all ingredients in a tall jug just large enough to fit a stick blender. Keep refrigerated until required.
https://www.recipetineats.com/jewelled-rice-pilaf/, Soak saffron – Grind saffron into a powder using a mortar and pestle (Note 1). Mix in boiling water then set aside while the rice is cooking. Sauté – Melt ghee or butter in large saucepan over medium high heat. Add fennel and cumin; then stir for 30 seconds. Add onion and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes. Add cinnamon; cardamom and all spice; then stir for 30 seconds. Add rice and stir for 1 minute to coat in the beautiful flavour. Cook rice – Add the stock; bay leaves; lemon; salt; fruit and nuts. Stir; bring to a simmer; then put lid on. Reduce stove to low (should still be simmering gently around edges); and cook for 14 minutes. Do not peek or stir! Rest – Quickly check to ensure liquid is absorbed. Remove from the stove (lid still on) and leave for 10 minutes. Yellow! Pour over half the saffron water then very gently fluff the rice using a rubber spatula (so you don't break the long rice strands). Once mostly mixed through; add remaining saffron water and ghee. Gently toss until the rice is all yellow. Serve – Tumble onto serving platter. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds; coriander; pistachios and serve with fish koftas.
https://www.recipetineats.com/jalapeno-popper-stuffed-chicken/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Cut pockets into each chicken breast (Note 2); taking care not to cut all the way through. Cut on the side with the fold in the meat; to keep the smooth side intact. Stuffing – Microwave the cream cheese for 30 seconds to soften. Mix together with remaining jalapeño popper stuffing ingredients.  Stuff & seal – Stuff inside the chicken pockets; stuffing it all the way in! Then seal each chicken with 2 or 3 toothpicks. If some stuffing is oozing out; that’s a bonus – it’s the best part when it crisps in the pan! Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with the paprika and salt. Sear – Heat the oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Place the breast smooth-side down; sear for 2 minutes until golden (it won't colour more in the oven). Flip and sear the other side for another 2 minutes. Bake 15 min – Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes; or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 67°C/155°F. Rest and serve – Remove the chicken to a plate and rest for 5 minutes; then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/egg-sandwich/, Mash egg: Place the eggs in a bowl and crush with a fork. Once mostly broken up; use a potato masher to mash them up really well. Smaller egg white bits = creamier filling. Filling: Add remaining filling ingredients and gently stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if desired; but add with caution because it's bizarre how little salt eggs can take! Make sandwich: Butter the bread. Divide filling between 4 pieces of bread; spread evenly edge to edge. Trim crusts (optional); then cut as you wish. (Note 4 tips) Serve: Always serve at room temperature; for best flavour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/roast-lamb-leg-with-gravy/, Take lamb out of fridge at least 1 hour before roasting. (Note 4) Preheat oven to 240°C/475°F (220°C fan) with oven shelf in the middle. Rub – Mix rosemary; garlic and olive oil. Prepare lamb – Place lamb leg in a roasting pan. Coat with the rub using your hands; the sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Place garlic and rosemary sprigs underneath the lamb; garlic cut face up. Roast lamb leg for 20 minutes. Turn the oven down to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan) and roast for a further 1 hour or until the internal temperature reaches 53°C/127°F for medium rare (Note 5 other doneness). Check first at 45 minutes – everyone's oven is different! Rest – Remove lamb from oven. Transfer lamb to plate; loosely cover with foil and rest for 20 minutes to 1 hour (it will still be warm enough for serving!). The internal temperature will rise to 62°C/144°F (medium rare). Make gravy while lamb is resting – below. Serve lamb with gravy; duck fat or classic crunchy roast potatoes; peas and steamed carrots tossed with butter and parsley.  Drippings in pan – Discard rosemary sprigs. You should have around 4 – 5 tbsp of fat (drippings). If less; add butter. If much more; discard a bit. Add flour – Place roasting pan on stove over medium heat. When the fat starts to bubble; then add flour. Mix flour in and cook for 1 minute. Stock – Pour in half the beef stock and mix to dissolve sludge in; then add remaining beef stock and mix. Garlic squidging – Use a potato masher (if you're really keen like me) to mush the garlic to squeeze out the flavour (also helps flour caught in garlic to dissolve). Taste – Check salt and pepper (I don't add more). Thicken – Simmer for a couple of minutes; stirring; until it starts to thicken. Take it off the stove BEFORE the gravy is the thickness you want because it will keep thickening. Strain into a bowl; mushing garlic to squeeze all the liquid out. Then pour into gravy jug and serve with lamb!
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-boil-eggs/, Water level 3cm/1" – Fill the saucepan with enough water so it will cover the eggs by 3cm / 1" or more. Boil first then add eggs – Bring to a rapid boil over high heat. Using a slotted spoon; gently lower fridge-cold eggs into the water. Lower heat – Reduce the heat slightly to medium high – water should still be bubbling but not so much the eggs are being bashed around so roughly they crack. (Note 3) Start the timer once all the eggs are in. – Dippy solders: 3 minutes (can't peel)– Runny yolks: 6 minutes– Soft boiled: 8 minutes– Hard boiled: 10 minutes Cool 10 minutes – Remove eggs using a slotted spoon into a large bowl or sink filled with plenty of cold tap water to cool the eggs. (Ice – Note 4) Cool 10 minutes. Peel from base in water – Crack the base of the shell by tapping it on the counter; then peel under water from the base (it's easier). Storing – Hard boiled eggs can be stored in the fridge for up to 7 days (peeled or unpeeled). Freezing not recommended (whites go weird).
https://www.recipetineats.com/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-shells/, Sauté – Heat oil in a small pot over medium high heat. Add garlic; onion; bay leaf; thyme and oregano.

Remove and allow to fully cool in the pan (~ 2 hours) before lifting out of the tin using the baking paper. (Speed things up: 30 min counter; 30 minute fridge) Cut into 16 squares. Enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pan-baked-sausage-and-lentils/, Pre-heat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Cooking vessel – Use a metal roasting pan ~23 x 33 cm / 9 x 13". Fold a sheet of baking/parchment paper (large enough to cover pan) in half and cut 4 x ~10cm/4" slits (steam vents! Note 4). Else; use foil – just tear steam vents. Sauté aromatics – Put the pan directly on the stove (really; it's ok!) and heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add eschallots and garlic; sauté for 3 minutes until soft. Add cumin seeds and stir for 1 minute.  Lentils & stock – Add dried lentils; carrot; salt; pepper and stock. Bring to a simmer. Sausages & paper – Gently place the sausages on top (don't press in).

Rest 5 min – Remove from the oven. Rest for 5 minutes. Serve the sausages with lentils. The flavour-loaded lentils are saucy so they act as the sauce for the sausages! Also pictured in post – baby spinach with Everyday Dressing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-lemon-coconut-almond-cake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Grease a 20cm/8” round cake pan (or springform pan) with butter then line with paper. Melt butter – Place the butter in a large microwavable bowl and melt in the microwave. Let cool for a couple of minutes. Wet ingredients – Add egg; vanilla and sugar and whisk until combined. Dry ingredients – Add almond meal; salt; baking powder; coconut and lemon zest. Whisk until combined.  Bake 40 minutes – Pour into pan. Sprinkle over almonds. Bake 40 minutes. Cool 15 minutes in pan then carefully turn out onto cooling rack. Cool at least 1 hour before cutting slices to serve. Moist enough to serve plain – doesn't need cream or anything!
https://www.recipetineats.com/vegetarian-lettuce-wraps/, Sauce – Mix cornflour/cornstarch with water until lump free. Add everything else; then mix. Crumble tofu – Drain tofu; then cut into 5mm/0.2" slices. Use your fingers to crumble into a mince. Not too fine crumbs; can always break up more when cooking (just like cooking mince/ground meat!). Filling – Heat oil over high heat in a large non stick pan. Cook onion; garlic and carrot for 1 minute. Add green beans and mushrooms. Cook 2 minutes – green beans should still be firm. Sauce it – Add tofu and toss through. Pour in the sauce. Stir for 1 minute or until the sauce thickens and is coating the mixture nicely. (If it evaporates too quickly; add a splash of water) Serving – Transfer filling into a bowl. Lay out on the table with lettuce leaves; green onion; peanuts and bottle of sriracha.

https://www.recipetineats.com/pesto-pasta-salad/, Cook pasta – Bring 3 litres of water to the boil with the salt. Cook for the pasta packet time + 1 minute. Drain in a colander; rinse under cold water. Shake off excess water well; then allow to fully cool and dry. Pesto – Place all ingredients in a tall jug just large enough to fit the head of a stick blender. Blitz under pretty smooth. Not a green smoothie; we still want some visible green bits! but not chunks. Toss – Place pasta in a bowl; scrape in the pesto. Add mayonnaise then toss well. Add bocconcini and tomato; toss gently just to disperse. Add rocket/arugula and toss just to disperse. Serve – Transfer into a serving bowl. Scatter with basil leaves; if using. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/toad-in-the-hole/, Batter – Whisk eggs in a bowl; then whisk in flour until lump free. Whisk in water; milk; mayonnaise; salt and pepper. Place in the fridge until required. Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Put the 1/4 cup beef drippings in a 23 x 33cm metal pan (9 x 13"). Place in the oven for 15 minutes to melt and become very hot. Brown sausages – Heat the 2 tsp (10g) of drippings in a pan over medium high heat. Brown the sausages all over; but keep one side just lightly browned (this side will brown more in the oven). Keep them raw inside. Remove onto a plate. Assemble – Take batter out of fridge and whisk. Working quickly; take the hot pan out of oven. Spread sausages in the pan; lightly browned side up; keeping clear of the pan walls (Note 5 for arranging tip). Pour the batter in around the sausages.  Bake – Bake 25 minutes on the top shelf until the sides puff up and is golden brown. The top of the edges should be nice and crispy! Serve immediately with onion gravy! Expect some deflation – though far less than typical recipes thanks to the mayo. Brown onion – Add beef drippings into the pan used for browning the sausages. Melt over high heat. Add onions and cook; stirring constantly; until nicely browned (~5 minutes). Add garlic and stir 30 seconds. Add flour and stir for 1 minute so it's well mixed through the onions (= lump-free gravy!). Add stock – Slowly pour in beef stock; stirring as you go. Add Worcestershire sauce; salt and pepper. Thicken – Bring to a simmer; stirring; for 2 minutes until thickens into a gravy. Keep warm until ready to use!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-fried-rice/, Mix Sauce ingredients in a small bowl; then set aside. Scramble eggs – Heat sesame oil in a large wok or non-stick pan over medium high heat.

Add beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; for 2 minutes or until you no longer see raw beef. Add 2 tablespoons of sauce and cook for 1 minute. Veg / caramelise beef – Add frozen vegetables and cook for 2 minutes or until the beef gets nicely caramelised – this is the trick to great flavour so do not shortcut this! Rice & sauce – Add rice and remaining sauce. Toss for 2 minutes until the sauce is well dispersed throughout the rice and the rice grains start to caramelise a bit. Egg & green onion – Then add scrambled eggs and green onion; give it a quick toss to disperse then divide between bowls. EAT!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-marinated-baby-octopus/, Braising – Put all the braising liquid ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add octopus; bring back up to the boil; then reduce the heat to low so the water is simmering very; very gently. Scoop off and discard scum off the surface when it accumulates.  Braise 1 hour until tender; first checking at the 45 minute mark; or until octopus is tender (take a little nibble to check!). Drain octopus in a colander. Pick out and discard the bay leaves; onion etc. Transfer octopus into a bowl. Marinate – Mix marinade ingredients in a bowl. Pour over the octopus (while still hot). Toss; allow to fully cool; cover with cling wrap then marinate overnight in the fridge. (Note 4) Cook until crispy (BBQ) – Heat a BBQ hot plate on medium high until hot. Spread oil across the hot plate. Use tongs to transfer the octopus onto the BBQ (leave residual oil behind); spread out and cook for 3 to 5 minutes; rotating as needed to brown all over; and most especially ensuring the legs are golden and crispy. (Stove – use a large skillet; cook in 2 or 3 batches). Serve – Pile octopus on a plate. Sprinkle with parsley and chilli; add lemon wedges. EAT and be happy! Serve with bread for mopping or see Note 4 for crushed potatoes pictured in post dressed with residual marinade.
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-baked-greek-chicken-orzo-risoni/, Marinade chicken – Combine Marinated Chicken ingredients in a bowl and set aside for marinate for 20 minutes. (Skip if in hurry; can also do overnight) Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan).

Sauté vegetables – Add 1 tbsp olive oil; garlic and onion. Saute for 1 minute; then add zucchini and bell peppers/capsicum. Cook for 2 minutes. Add everything else – Add risoni; oregano; chicken broth; tomato; tomato paste; salt and pepper. Scatter chicken and cherry tomatoes across the surface (don't stir in). Bake 15 minutes – Once the liquid comes to a simmer; transfer to the oven (no lid) and bake for 15 minutes (or until risoni is just cooked; tender but still firm). There may be liquid on the surface still – that's good! Drizzle with lemon – Remove from oven; drizzle with lemon juice. Garnish with feta and fresh oregano leaves; if desired; then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/muesli-bars-granola-bars/, Mix Add-ins – Using a wooden spoon; mix the add-ins in a large microwaveable bowl (just in case; Note 4). Glue – Using a rubber spatula; mix the peanut butter and honey in a saucepan over medium heat until smooth. Once combined; turn the stove down to low. As soon as you start seeing little bubbles around the edges; cook for 5 minutes; stirring constantly scraping the base; until it is like a very thick caramel (see photos and video in post). You should be able to draw a path across the base and it holds before closing in on itself. DO NOT WALK AWAY; it will catch easily. (Note 5) Mix – Immediately pour it all over surface of the oats etc then mix with the wooden spoon. It takes a bit of effort but it does come together eventually. Stabbing and smearing against the wall of the bowl helps. If it gets too thick; microwave for 20 seconds on high to loosen the glue then mix (then it's a breeze!). Press – Put a square piece of paper over a 20cm/8" square tin (no need to grease). Drop muesli mix in then spread right into the corners; using a combination of your hands and the wooden spoon. Firmer press = chewier muesli bars. Set – Refrigerate 2 hours until firm then cut into 10 bars (cut in half; then each half into 5).
https://www.recipetineats.com/purple-rice-red-cabbage-rice/, Melt butter in a large saucepan or small pot over medium heat. (Note 3) Sauté veg – Cook onion and garlic for 1 minute until soft. Add cabbage; salt; and pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes; stirring from time to time; until the cabbage starts to soften but not completely floppy (as it will cook more with the rice). Coat rice – Add rice and stir well to coat in the flavour. Add the vegetable stock. Scrape down the sides and press the cabbage-rice mixture down so all the rice is submerged. Cook 12 minutes – Bring to a simmer; then cover with a lid; turn the stove down to medium low (or low on a stronger burner) and cook for 12 minutes. Do not peek or stir! Rest 10 minutes – Turn off the heat; remove the saucepan from the stove and let to rest for another 10 minutes (with the lid on). Fluff & serve – Use a rubber spatula or rice paddle to fluff the rice then tumble into a serving dish. Sprinkle with green onion and serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chili-dogs/, Sauté aromatics – Heat oil over medium high in a heavy based pot. Cook the onion; garlic and capsicum for 3 minutes. Brown beef – Add beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; until you no longer see raw meat. Add tomato paste and stir for 1 minute. Sauce – Add the spices; tomato; water; crumbled beef cube and salt. Stir well. Slow cook 3 hours –  Bring the chili to a simmer then turn down to low; on a small burner. Put the lid partially on (to allow for sauce reduction). Simmer for 3 hours on low (goal: small bubble every now and then); stirring just to ensure the base doesn’t catch. OR put it in a 160°C/325°F oven for 3 hours (lid partially cracked). Slow cooker (Note 4) – Reduce water to 3/4 cup. After chili comes to a simmer on the stove; transfer everything to a slow cooker then cook on low for 6 to 8 hours on low. Thicken sauce – Remove 1 1/2 cups of the chili into a container so the head of a stick blender will be submerged under the chili. Then blitz until smooth (~ 15 seconds). Add the pureed sauce back in the pot and stir well.  Sauce goal – As you stir; the remaining beef bits should become quite fine (rather than bolognese type chunks) because the beef is so tender. If the beef bits are not as small as desired; use a potato masher in the pot – it won't take long. The chili sauce should be a thick sauce that mounds up a bit when you scoop it; not runny. (Note 5) Keep sauce warm. Optional rest overnight – Allow the sauce to cool then refrigerate overnight. As with most slow-cooked stewy things; the flavour improves! Reheat on the stove before proceeding. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Grill/pan-fry – Preheat a pan with 1/2 tbsp oil (or the BBQ) on medium / medium high. Brown the stages all over until they are heated through (they are already cooked inside; it's just about heating/colour). Assemble – Place hot dog buns on a tray. Stuff with a sausage; top with a squiggle of mustard and a sprinkle of onion. Spoon over a generous amount of warm chili sauce; top with cheese.

https://www.recipetineats.com/mango-pancakes/, Batter – Place the milk in a bowl. Sift the flour; cornflour and icing sugar in then whisk until lump free. Add eggs and food colouring; whisk until combined. It will be a very thin; watery batter. Refrigerate for 1 hour. (Note 3) Measure batter – Give the batter a mix (to stir in flour settled at bottom) then measure out 45 ml (3 tbsp) of crepe batter. Non-stick pan – Use a 18cm/7" non-stick pan (Note 4). Spray lightly with oil then heat over a medium low stove. Cook pancake – Pour the batter into the middle – it should sizzle very lightly – then swirl to cover the base in a thin layer. Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute or until the middle is set to touch. About halfway through cooking; start loosening the edges with a rubber spatula to ensure it flips out easily.  Flip the crepe out upside down onto a large cutting board. GOAL: Surface is set; underside has no golden patches. (Note 5) Adjust heat as needed. Cook more! Spray pan with oil then continue cooking the pancakes. You can flip them out on top of each other. Cool – Full cool the crepes for 1 hour before using. Cream – Just before assembling; place the cream; icing sugar and vanilla in a cold bowl and beat until stiff (about 2 minutes on speed 8 of a 10 speed hand mixer). Filling – Place a crepe on a work surface so the side that was in contact with the pan is facing up. (Note 6) Spread 1cm/1/3" thick layer of cream one-third of the way up the pancake; in the shape of a piece of mango. Top with mango. Roll; burrito style (see step photos or video); ending with the seam-side down. Repeat with remaining pancakes. Serve immediately! Mango pancakes wait for no-one (due to the cream).
https://www.recipetineats.com/lunchbox-pizza-bread/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Oil spray a 23 x 33 cm (9 x 13") metal pan then line with baking / parchment paper (Note 3). Whisk Dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk Wet ingredients in a separate bowl until combined. Combine Wet & Dry – Pour Wet into the Dry ingredients. Mix with a rubber spatula until the flour is mostly mixed in but you can still see a bit of flour. Add cheese then stir until you can no longer see flour. Some small lumps is fine; they will bake out. Assemble – Scrape into the baking pan and evenly spread – it's not that thick; remember it rises! Spread the surface with pizza sauce. Sprinkle with cheese; then (in this order) onion; capsicum; olives then pepperoni. Bake 40 min – Bake 25 minutes uncovered. Cover with a baking tray (or foil) then bake for a further 15 minutes. Cool 10 minutes in the pan then use the paper overhang to lift or slide out onto a cooling rack. Cool for a further 10 minutes before slicing to serve. Serving – Great at room temp though for VIP's; sometimes I warm it in the oven; drizzle with a swish of olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of oregano.

Cook guanciale – While the pasta is cooking; place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the guanciale heats up; the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic; add it in the last minute. Pasta in pan – Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat. Mix pasta in sauce – Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands! Serve – Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately; garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired; and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.
https://www.recipetineats.com/gazpacho/, Marinate – Toss all the gazpacho ingredients together in a large bowl. Cover then set aside to marinate; preferably 12 to 24 hours; or at least 3 hours. (Note 3) Blitz – Transfer everything into a blender and blitz on high until smooth. (Or use a tall jug with a hand blender).

Dressing – Place Dressing ingredients in a jar and shake well. Toss! Add Salad ingredients into the bowl; pour over Dressing and toss. Serve at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/truly-crispy-oven-baked-buffalo-wings-my-wings-cookbook/, Dry overnight (optional) – If you plan ahead; lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Alternatively; pat them dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter. Line the tray with foil. Put a rack on the tray then spray the rack with oil.  Toss wings – Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly. Bake 30 minutes on low temp – Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug; they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes. Bake 40 minutes on high – Move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425°F / 220°C (all oven types). Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes; rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over. They are ready when dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy. Toss in sauce – Transfer the wings into a large bowl. Pour over sauce and toss to coat. (Alternatively; serve wings plain with Buffalo Sauce for dipping). Serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip (for both wings and celery sticks dunking)! Whisk together the Sauce ingredients until the sugar is melted. Keep warm or reheat just prior to using. Mash the blue cheese with sour cream until smooth (or to your taste). Add remaining ingredients and mix well until combined; using milk to get it to the consistency you want. Store in the fridge until required. Remove from the fridge 15 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/rum-raisin-ice-cream/, Chop – Roughly chop the raisins (about in half) and break them up with your fingers so they are not stuck together. Soak – Heat the rum in a small saucepan on medium high; just until hot. Add raisins; spread to submerge as best you can. Then leave to soak for 30 minutes. Pour off excess – The raisins should absorb most of the rum. If not; see Note 4. Condensed milk & flavourings – Place the condensed milk; rum; vanilla and all-spice in a bowl. Briefly beat just to combine with a handheld beater (or mix by hand); then stir in the rum soaked raisins. Whipped cream – Place the cream in a separate large bowl and beat on high with an electric beater for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until well whipped (stand mixer 1 – 1 1/2 minutes). We're not looking for "soft whipped" here; we want stiff peaks and good aeration! Fold together – Fold about 1 cup whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture. Once mostly incorporated (some lumps is fine); pour the condensed milk mixture into the cream and gently continue folding until smooth (minimise folding as less aeration = denser ice cream). To help remove lumps; "smear" visible cream bits across the surface or against the side of the bowl rather than vigorously stirring. Freeze 12 hours – Spread in a 1.5 litre / 1.5 quart container (Note 6). Cover with lid or cling wrap. Freeze at least 12 hours. Serve! To scoop; you'll only need to leave it out for a minute or two; like real ice cream! Then scoop and serve in bowls or in cones. I topped mine with chopped rum raisin chocolate; because; why not? 🙂
https://www.recipetineats.com/jamaican-rice-and-peas/, Preheat oven to  200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Sauté aromatics – Melt butter over medium-high heat in a medium or large ovenproof pot (Note 5). Cook garlic; onion; thyme; all spice; bay leaves; scotch bonnet until onion is translucent (~ 3 minutes). Add coconut milk; water; beans and salt. Once it comes to a simmer; add rice then give it a quick stir. Once you see bubbles breaking the surface; immediately cover then transfer to oven.  Bake for 40 minutes. All liquid should be absorbed (tilt to check) though you will have some coconut cream on the surface. Rest – Leave the pot on the counter with the lid on for 15 minutes. Then fluff and serve!

https://www.recipetineats.com/jamaican-jerk-fish/, Jerk Spice Blend – Mix the Jerk Seasoning spices together in a bowl then spread in a small tray that is just large enough to fit one fish fillet. Coat fish – Pat fish dry with a paper towel. Then coat both sides of each fillet with the jerk seasoning; pressing to adhere. Shake off excess; place on a clean plate and coat remaining fish. Cook fish – Heat half the oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat. When you see small wisps of smoke; place 2 fillets presentation side down and cook for 2 minutes. Flip – the spice crust should be a deep bronze colour with a reddish tinge. Cook the other side for 1 minute until the target internal temperature is 55°C/130°F; or the fish flakes easily at the thickest point. Rest on a rack for 2 minutes (to preserve crispy spice crust). Then serve! Recipes for pictured Jamaican sides coming on Tuesday – stay tuned!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-custard-cake/, Prepare pan: Flip the base of a 20cm / 8" springform pan upside down – this makes it easier to remove the finished cake without the lip in the way. Grease pan base with butter; then press on a square sheet of baking paper. Clip the pan sides onto the base; letting the excess paper stick out (ease of removal later). Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan-forced). Heat the milk; vanilla and about half the sugar in a large saucepan over medium high heat until just before boiling; stirring to dissolve the sugar. Yolk mixture: Place egg yolks and remaining sugar in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add cornflour and whisk until smooth. Temper eggs: While whisking the eggs; slowly pour in the hot milk in a thin stream while whisking. Whisk until fully combined. Thicken custard: Pour the egg-milk mixture back into the same saucepan. Place over medium low heat; stirring constantly so the base doesn't catch; until it starts to thicken (you will feel it). It should happen within 3 to 5 minutes. If it gets lumpy; remove off heat; whisk vigorously – will become smooth. Stir 45 sec after bubbles: When the custard is thickened and steamy; and you see the first big lazy bubbles appear on the base (pause whisking to see); whisk constantly on the stove for a further 45 seconds then remove from stove. Add chocolate and stir until fully melted. Cool: Transfer into a bowl; immediately cover with cling wrap touching the surface. (You can strain if you're concerned about lumps). Set aside while preparing the base. Blitz cookies: Roughly break up Oreos with hands and place in food processor. Blitz until they become fine crumbs. Add melted butter; then blitz again until combined. Press: Transfer crumbs into prepared pan; pressing evenly and firmly on to the base (I use the underside of a straight-sided; flat-bottomed cup measure to do this). Bake 1 hour: Whisk custard until smooth to loosen. Pour onto the base; smooth surface. Bake 60 minutes; rotating the cake pan at the 45 minute mark. It will still be wobbly when you pull it out of the oven. Cool for 3 hours on the counter; in the pan. Refrigerate at least 12 hours to allow the custard to fully set. Serve: Best to cut when fridge cold and serve at room temp (for creamiest custard!). Remove springform sides and paper; then use paper overhang to slide the cake off the base. Cut like cake and serve! Lovely with dollop of Chantilly cream and a raspberry or strawberry. Dust with icing sugar to make it pretty!
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-mexican-chicken-rice/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160° fan). Mexican spice mix – Mix the ingredients in a small bowl. Rub Chicken – Place 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Mexican Spice Mix in a large bowl (reserve rest for rice) with 1 tablespoon olive oil and lime juice. Mix to form a paste then add the chicken and toss to coat the chicken.  Marinate (optional) – Marinate chicken for 1 hour; or even overnight; if you have the time. Otherwise; it's fine to proceed with the recipe! Sear chicken – Using a large deep skillet preferably with a lid (Note 6); heat the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat. Sear the skin side of the chicken for 4 minutes until light golden; then sear the flesh side for 1 1/2 minutes (will still be raw inside). Remove onto a plate. Sauté aromatics – If you've got a lot of burnt spices on the base; scrape off and discard some of it. Then in the same skillet; still over medium high heat; add the onion; garlic and capsicum (bell peppers). Sauté for 3 minutes until the onion softens. Rice & liquid – Add the rice and stir. Add chicken stock; tomato passata; corn; beans and remaining Mexican Spice Mix. Stir to combine. Top with chicken – Place chicken on top of the rice; skin side up. It will be partially submerged but most of the skin should be above the liquid. Bake covered 25 min – Bring to simmer; then cover skillet with a lid or foil and place in the oven for 25 minutes. Bake uncovered 15 min – Remove the lid/foil and bake for a further 15 minutes until only small puddles of liquid remain on the surface of the rice. Rest 10 minutes – Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes (uncovered). Any remaining liquid will evaporate in this step. Serve – Squeeze the juice of 1 lime over the chicken and rice. Remove chicken or push to the side then fluff the rice. Serve; garnished with coriander/cilantro leaves; extra lime wedges and sliced jalapeños; if desired. Sour cream also goes well with this; or a dollop of guacamole or avocado sauce!

https://www.recipetineats.com/salisbury-steak-meatballs-with-mushroom-gravy/, Grated onion – Place the breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Using a standard box grater; grate the onion over the panko so it soaks in. Mix through. Meatball mixture – Add remaining Meatball ingredients and mix well with your hands until thoroughly combined. Roll balls – Roll 20 to 22 balls (1 1/2 tablespoons of mixture). I use an ice cream scoop with lever; handy! Slurry – Mix ingredients in a bowl until smooth. We will use this to thicken the gravy (no lumpy gravy; yay!) Brown meatballs – Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook meatballs; using tablespoons to roll (to minimise deforming) until browned on the outside but still raw inside. Remove onto a plate and set aside. Sauté mushrooms – Melt butter in the same skillet still on high. Cook mushrooms until they start to soften (~ 2 minutes). Add salt; pepper and the garlic; then cook for a further 2 minutes until the garlic is golden and mushrooms are soft. Make gravy – Add beef stock; salt; pepper and slurry; then stir to combine. Simmer meatballs – Once the liquid starts to simmer; add meatballs and any juices pooled on the plate. Adjust heat to medium so it's simmering gently and cook for 5 minutes until gravy is thickened and meatballs are cooked through.  Serve over mash sprinkled with parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/blinis-with-smoked-salmon/, Foamy yeast 10 min – Warm a small bowl by running under warm water; then wipe dry. (Note 6). Mix the warm water; yeast and 1/4 tsp of the sugar in the bowl until yeast is mostly dissolved (some small floating lumps ok). Cover with cling wrap and leave in a warm place for 10 minutes until the surface is foamy.  Mix dry – With a wooden spoon; mix both flours; salt and the rest of the sugar in a separate medium bowl. Add wet – Stir in milk; butter; egg and all the foamy yeast mixture. Mix well until incorporated. It will be runny like pancake batter.  Rise 1 1/2 hours – Cover with cling wrap and set in another larger bowl filled with 3cm/1" of warm water (to create a cosy; warm environment for batter rising). Let the batter rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until it doubles in volume and has bubbles breaking the surface. Piping bag – Stir batter before using. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with 4mm (1/6") round piping tip (or snip a 6 mm / 1/4" hole in the end). Tie off the piping bag end with a rubber band (loosely; as batter keeps expanding). Spray pan with oil – Place a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Once hot; remove pan from stove; spray lightly with oil then return to stove (⚠️Note 7) Cook – Pipe 2.5cm / 1" rounds that spread to 4cm / 1.7" in the pan. Cook the first side 45 seconds to 1 minute or until it has golden spots in the middle and has the signature gold Blini "ring" around it. Flip and cook the other side for 30 seconds.

https://www.recipetineats.com/mini-pavlovas/, Egg whites – Separate the egg yolks from egg whites while fridge cold (it's easier). Measure out 2/3 cup (160 ml) egg whites then set aside to come to room temperature for 30 minutes (fluffs better at room temp). Preheat oven to 150°C / 325°F (all oven types). Add sugar – In a stand mixer or using an electric beater; beat the egg whites on high for 1 minute. While still beating; add the sugar 1 dessert spoon at a time. Beat 8 minutes – Continue to beat for 8 minutes on high until it's fluffy; glossy; and there are no sugar grains remaining when you rub a bit between your fingers. Add vinegar and cornflour then beat for a further 30 seconds. Line tray – Dab a bit on the corner of 2 trays then cover with baking paper (parchment).  Pipe mounds Transfer meringue mixture into a large piping bag fitted with nozzle of choice. Pipe 12 – 13 mounds 6 – 7 cm / 2.5" wide about 5 cm / 2" tall. Use a spoon to flatten and make a slight dent on the surface to hold cream and fruit. Pavs should end up about 4 cm / 1.6" high. Bake 1 hour 30 minutes – Place both trays in the oven; immediately turn oven DOWN to 110°C/225°F (100°C fan) and bake for 1 hour 30 minutes or until they are dry to touch. Keep baking if still sticky – exact times may vary. (Note 4) Cool in oven – Turn oven OFF and leave to fully cool for 4 hours or overnight around 10 hours (I usually do this). Airtight container – As soon as the pavs are fully cool; store in an airtight container in a cool; dry place until required.

Decorate – Just before serving; spoon a big dollop of cream in the nest; top with fruit and dust with icing sugar if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-make-glazed-ham-the-day-before/, Bake day before – Make the Maple Glazed Ham or Brown Sugar Glazed Ham the day per the recipe; before when you’ve got time to baby-sit the ham in the oven; basting and brushing as much as needed for the perfect golden glaze. Cool for 2 – 3 hours on the counter until you can barely feel warmth when you hover your hand over the surface. However; the inside will still be warm – it’s a sizeable hunk of meat we’re working with here! Don’t leave a hot ham out for much longer than this; for food safety reasons. Fridge 3 hours uncovered – Then refrigerate the ham uncovered for 3 to 6 hours (still in the pan; with all the pan juices) to allow the inside of the ham to cool right down. You do not want to cover the ham while there’s even a bit of residual warmth on the inside because it will make the ham sweat = compromises the glaze. 😩 Refrigerate overnight – Cover the ham loosely with a sheet of baking/parchment paper (the glaze won’t stick) then loosely with foil or cling wrap. (Note 1 Refrigerating uncovered if pressed for time) De-chill – Take the ham out of the fridge 2 hours prior. Reheating glaze only (what I usually do) – Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Put the ham in and reheat until the glaze is rejuvenated; about 30 – 40 minutes. Don't worry about heating the ham all the way through. Baste as needed using the pan juices (sludge brush in most caramelised parts of the pan). Reheating all the way through – Cover loosely with baking paper then foil. Reheat in a 150°C/300°F (130°C fan) oven for 2 – 2 1/2 hours or until the centre of the ham registers 60°C/140°F; remove the cover towards the end and basting once or twice. (We don't want the ham to get too brown; so don't remove the foil too early) Broiler/ oven-grill speed up – If you have pesky patches that won't colour; don't hesitate to use the broiler/oven grill on high. It works fast (it can be 1 – 2 minutes) so keep an eye on it; and be sure to cover the areas sufficiently coloured with foil (it doesn't get stuck). Presentation – Plate up the ham as you ordinarily do; leaving the ham out for up 2 hours. Reduce the ham pan juices; if needed; to serve as the ham sauce. Final baste – Reserve some of the ham juices (try to scoop out the most caramelised coloured section) in a mug to give it a final baste to make the glaze super shiny just before serving (microwave to melt if needed). Bask in the glory of your magnificent glazed ham! Then carve into thin slices and serve alongside the ham sauce. Cheeky tip – Loosely cover the plate of carved ham with cling wrap and microwave briefly to warm it up; if you are really hung up on having warm ham!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-sandwiches/, Shred the chicken as finely as you can. The best method is using a stand-mixer. Just put the meat in the bowl with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until it's really finely shredded (~ 1 minute). Else use a handheld beater or your hands. Mix the Sauce ingredients in a bowl until smooth – use a whisk if needed. Pour Sauce over the chicken. Add remaining Filling ingredients. Stir until combined. Spread bread with butter. Spread with Filling (see below for amount). Remove crusts if desired (for the authentic "gourmet" experience!) and cut in half. (Tip: For really neat cuts; refrigerate sandwiches before slicing so Filling firms up). Serve on platters littered with green fluffage; if desired! Chicken filling per sandwich:– Deli standard (recommended): 100g / 1/2 cup (makes 10 sandwiches)– Very generous: 130g / 1/2 cup (makes 8)– Everyday lunchbox: 80g (1/3 cup) (makes 15).
https://www.recipetineats.com/honey-soy-wings/, Mix marinade in a bowl until honey is dissolved. Pour over the wings in a ziplock bag. (Note 3) Marinade for 30 minutes. You can do overnight but it doesn't noticeably improve flavour in the flesh. Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Line a large tray with foil then paper. Bake – Spread wings out on the tray; skin side up. Reserve marinade. Bake 30 minutes.  Drain off juices on the tray and discard. (Key step to ensure sauce thickens). Sauce – Pour reserved marinade over wings. Toss to coat then spread the wings out; skin side up. Bake & baste – Turn oven down to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Bake wings for 30 minutes; basting with tray juices every 10 minutes (3 times). Rearrange wings as needed if cooking unevenly; you can even turn them upside down if they brown too quickly. Sauce should be syrupy by the end so you can glaze well. (Note 4 if sauce still watery). Serve – Transfer wings into a serving bowl. Pour over syrup on tray; sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onion. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/eclairs/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Position one shelf in the top third of the oven and another in the lower third. Lightly spray 3 trays with canola oil and line with baking/parchment paper. Simmer liquid – Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When the butter is almost melted; add water. Flour – Once the liquid starts simmering; add flour and salt; and vigorously stir with a wooden spoon (while still on the stove). The mixture will turn pasty then in about 10 seconds it will transform into a sticky ball of dough that comes away from the walls of the saucepan. Once this happens; remove from the stove and leave to cool for 10 minutes (no longer). Eggs – Add eggs one at a time; mixing vigorously with a wooden spoon after each addition; making sure each egg is incorporated before adding the next. At first; the mixture will look separated but when you keep stirring; it comes together. When finished the mixture should be a sticky; thick paste that holds its shape; not sloppy and loose (see video or photos). Pipe – Transfer mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 15 mm star tip (Note 8). Pipe logs 12-14 cm long; 2.5 cm wide; 1.5 cm tall; 5 cm apart from each other. (5" long; 1" wide; 0.6" tall; 2" apart) Do not crowd the tray else they won’t go crispy. You should get around 20. Bake 2 trays on the shelves for 45 minutes. At the 30 minute mark; open the oven door for 2 seconds to release steam (makes them crispier); then again at 35 minutes and 40 minutes. Remove the tray at 45 minutes. Cool – Remove choux buns from the oven and allow to fully cool on the trays. If you used 3 trays; bake the 3rd tray of choux pastry per above directions. Split – Slice choux buns in half horizontally. Place chocolate in a bowl. Pour over hot cream – Heat cream and glucose in a small saucepan over medium heat until just below boiling. Pour mixture over chocolate; shake so the chocolate is submerged. Let stand for 1 minute. Mix with a rubber spatula until smooth (do not use a whisk; it creates bubbles). Transfer into a wide; shallow bowl large enough to dip the eclairs.  Coat eclairs – Dip the lid of each éclair into the chocolate. Place on a tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes until the chocolate is firm to the touch. Whip cream – Place all the Chantilly Cream ingredients in a bowl. Whip using an electric beater on medium high for 3 minutes or until stiff peaks form. Transfer into piping bag fitted with a star tip. Fill eclairs –  Pipe in cream using whatever pattern takes your fancy; generously thick. Place the lid on then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chantilly-cream-lightly-sweetened-whipped-cream/, Whip cream – Place the cream; icing sugar; vanilla of choice plus mascarpone (if making stabilised cream). Whip using an electric beater on medium high; moving the beater around the bowl; or until whipped to stiffness you are after. Then it's ready for use! Stiffness options – Whip for around 1 1/2 minutes if you want soft peaks (kind of dollops) or 2 minutes for stiff peaks (for piping). See in post for photos of soft vs stiff peaks. If scaling up; it will take longer.  To use –  Fill a piping bag with nozzle of choice and pipe. Spread onto cakes or dollop on a bowl of fruit or onto pies!
https://www.recipetineats.com/make-ahead-mashed-potato-casserole/, Place bacon in a cold non-stick pan over medium heat (no oil). As the pan heats up the bacon fat will melt. Once you see some melted bacon fat; turn the heat up to medium high and stir for 3 minute or until golden. Drain on paper towels.  Potatoes – Peel then cut into 3cm /1" chunks. Boil – Place in a large pot and cover with water so it’s 10cm / 4” above the potatoes. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat so it’s simmering rapidly. Cook 15 minutes or until potatoes are very soft (jab with fork to test; they should fall apart). Drain well; then return into pot. Leave for 1 minute; shaking pot every now and then; to encourage evaporation of water. Mash – Add milk (including EXTRA milk if making-ahead); butter; sour cream and 1 tsp salt. Mash until smooth. (Do not use food processor; blender or beater; makes it gluey!) Fridge – Allow to fully cool on the counter then cover tightly with cling wrap and refrigerate. Dechill – Take out onto counter 2 hours prior to reheating. Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan). Spread the potato in a 2 litre / 2 quart baking dish (Note 5). Smooth the surface. Sprinkle – Sprinkle potato with the cheeses; then bacon. Bake covered – Cover loosely with foil. Bake for 20 minutes covered (if freshly made) or 35 minutes (make-ahead option). Bake uncovered – Remove foil then bake a further 10 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Serve – Sprinkle with green onion then serve! It stays warm for a good 20 minutes thanks to that protective layer of cheese. Oh; the powers of cheese!
https://www.recipetineats.com/apple-pie-recipe/, Shortcrust: Make a double batch of my shortcrust pastry recipe. Form the dough discs; wrap and refrigerate per the recipe. Line tin: Roll out one dough just large enough to fit a 23cm/9" metal pie tin; following directions in the shortcrust recipe. You want the base relatively thick so it's sturdy. Trim off excess pastry; prick the base 30 times with a fork (don't pierce through). Freeze (Note 4): Cover with cling wrap and freeze for 2 hours.  While crust is freezing; make apple filling. Then continue with pie crust steps. Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan). Blind bake (Note 5): Place two large sheets of baking/parchment paper in a "X" over the pie tin then fill with baking beads (Note 4). Bake 25 minutes.  Egg wash (Note 5): Remove from oven. Use paper excess to remove beads into a bowl. Brush base and sides (not rim) lightly with whisked egg. Return crust to oven for 5 minutes. Cool: Crust should be light golden and look fully cooked. Cool 15 minutes before filling. Remove remaining dough from fridge 30 minutes prior. Roll out to 3 mm / 1/8" thick and cut into 12 x  2.5cm/1" strips. Transfer to board; cover with cling wrap and refrigerate until required. Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan). Spice mix: Mix the sugar; cinnamon; ginger; nutmeg and salt in a bowl. Toss: In a large bowl; sprinkle spice mix over apple slices. Toss well with hands; separating pieces that are stuck together. Bake: Spread across 2 large trays. Bake until soft but still holding form – check first at 15 min; and every 5 mins thereafter (mine take 40 min – Note 7). Do not stir or rotate trays. Drain off juices: Remove trays from oven. Using a spatula to hold the apples back; pour apple juices into a saucepan (drain off what you can; you don't need every drop). Cool apple: Leave apple slices to cool on the tray; about 15 minutes. Apple syrup: Add butter to apple juice saucepan and simmer on low heat until it reduces to 1/3 cup (80 ml); becoming syrupy. This might take 1 minute if you didn't start with much juices; or 3 – 5 minutes if you started with 1/2 cup or more juices. Remove from stove and let cool. Turn oven up to 200°C/400°F (180°C fan). Fill: Use a spatula or egg flip to scoop up apple slices. Fill the pie crust with 2/3 of the apples; gently pressing out air pockets. Then arrange the remaining apples on top so they mound slightly at the centre. Pour apple syrup over the slices and any residual juices from the baking trays. Pastry lattice or lid: Top with pastry lattice – see in post for my method. Trim excess; and press to adhere on to pie crust rim using water to seal. Brush lattice with egg wash (avoid the pie rim else it will over-brown there); ensuring you don't get pools of egg in the joins. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake 45 minutes or until the pastry is golden and you see the syrup bubbling through the lattice. Serving fresh: Cool at least 3 hours before cutting to serve! Option for neat slices: After cooling; refrigerate overnight. Turn pie out of pie dish (it's sturdy enough once cooled). Then you can cut neat slices. Place on a tray; cover with foil and reheat for 10 minutes in a 180°C/350°F oven (or microwave in emergency!). In either case serve with vanilla ice cream; always!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-in-creamy-mustard-sauce/, Season chicken with the salt and pepper. Sear chicken thighs – Heat oil in a large pan that is not non-stick over medium-high heat.

Add a pile of vegetables of choice on the side. Dive in!
https://www.recipetineats.com/mini-cheesecakes/, Preheat oven to 160°C / 325°F (140°C fan) with the shelf 1/3 from the bottom of the oven. Line a 12-hole standard muffin tin with paper muffin liners. Blitz: Break the crackers up with your hands then blitz in a food processor until they form fine crumbs – about 10 seconds or so. (Note 4) Add remaining Base ingredients; blitz to combine. It should have the texture of wet sand. Press: Divide mixture between the muffin tin holes. Press down firmly to flatten using something flat and round. A 1/3 cup measure fits perfectly in mine my tin holes for this purpose. Bake: Backe for 7 minutes then cool bases for 5 minutes before filling. Filling (Note 5): Beat cream cheese on speed 5 of an electric beater just until smooth (~ 10 seconds). Add flour; vanilla; sour cream; sugar and lemon.

Chill: Remove from the oven then cool for 1 hour on the counter in the muffin tin. When cooled; cover with baking/parchment paper then loosely with cling wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably overnight; or until the liner can be peeled off cleanly. De-chill: If you have the time; remove cheesecakes from the fridge 30 minutes prior to serving; to take some of the fridge chill out (the cheesecake is nicer at room temperature). Chantilly cream: Place ingredients in a bowl and beat on high until the cream is thick enough to pipe/dollop. Decorate: Pipe or dollop with cream; decorate with berries; dust with icing sugar. Serve proudly!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-feta-dip/, Feta Dip: Place all ingredients except the oil in a food processor. Blitz on high for 10 seconds or until pretty smooth; scraping down the sides once. (You could also use a stick blender; but a stand mixer will not work) Olive oil: With the motor running; slowly pour the olive oil through the feeder then blitz until the dip is smooth and creamy; scraping down the sides as needed. Spread on a shallow bowl-plate / regular plate so it's around 1.5cm / 0.6" thick. Use the back of a spoon to create swirls for the honey and oil to pool in. Drizzle over the honey and olive oil. Sprinkle with pistachios; parsley; chilli and lemon. Serve immediately with dippers of choice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pasta-primavera/, Broccolini – Cut off florets then cut in half lengthwise. Then slice the stems diagonally into 2.5 cm / 1" lengths. Snow peas – Remove the tough string running down the "seam" of the pea. Stack several peas and slice on the diagonal about 1cm / 0.4" wide. Asparagus – Snap the base off the asparagus; it will naturally break where the woody stem stars. Cut tips off; leave whole and set aside. Slice the stems diagonally into 2.5 cm / 1" lengths. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cream and Parmigiano reggiano. Stir; and once the cream starts simmering gently; stir until the cheese melts then take it off the stove and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to the boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and add the pasta. Cook for the time per the packet minus 1 minute. Meanwhile; cook vegetables. Reserve pasta water: Just before draining the pasta; scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta. Mushrooms: Heat half the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.

(If at any stage the pasta gets too thick; add a splash more pasta water and toss on stove). Basil & pine nuts – Quickly toss through basil. Divide between 4 bowls. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Devour immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cinnamon-apple-bread/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Position shelf in the middle of the oven.  Loaf pan (Note 7): Use a 21.5 x 11.5 x 7 cm / 4.5 x 8.5 x 2.75" pan. Spray with canola oil then line the long side + base with a single piece of paper leaving some overhang (don’t worry about lining short sides). Topping: Mix the Demerara sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside. Cinnamon Apple: Mix Cinnamon Apple ingredients in a bowl. Set aside while you prepare the batter (the sugar will make the apple sweat = good thing!). Batter: Whisk the Dry ingredients in a bowl. In a separate bowl; whisk Wet ingredients. Pour Wet mix into the Dry bowl; whisk just until smooth. Stir in apples (including all juices) and walnuts. Batter should be thick but dollop-able (not pourable in thin stream; nor thick like sticky bread dough). Scrape into loaf pan; smooth surface. Topping: Take 1/4 of the apple slices; fan out (so they're overlapping) then arrange on top. Repeat in two more lots of 1/4 of an apple. (I find to cover the surface; I only use 3/4 of the apple.) Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. Bake 60 minutes. Cover loosely with foil; bake for further 25 minutes or until skewer inserted into the centre comes out smooth. Rest 15 minutes in the pan then use paper overhang to remove to a rack. Cool at least 1 hour on rack before slicing!  Serving – The bread is moist and flavoured enough to eat plain though nobody complains if it's lightly toasted and slathered with butter!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chilli-lime-fish/, Dust fish – Sprinkle with salt; dust with rice flour; shake off excess. Cook fish – In a non-stick skillet; heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook the fish until golden on each side then remove to a plate. Fish cooking times – Thin fillets 1 cm / 2/5" thick: 1 1/2 minutes each side; thicker fillets 1.5 – 1.75cm / 0.6 – 0.75" thick 2 minutes each side) or until the internal temperature is 55°C / 130°F.

https://www.recipetineats.com/my-best-pulled-pork/, Dry brine overnight (Note 7) – Pat the pork dry and place in a large ceramic dish. Mix Brine ingredients in a small bowl and rub it all over the pork; being sure to get into the cracks and crevices. Turn it fat side up (smoother side) covered with as much rub as possible. Refrigerate uncovered for 24 hours. Preheat oven to 110°C (both fan-forced and standard) / 230°F. Prepare for roasting – Transfer pork to a roasting pan (do not wipe the rub off) with the fat side up. Discard any liquid and residual rub left in the brining dish. Pour beer and water around the pork; topping up with extra water as needed so the liquid level is 2.5 cm / 1" (insurance against pan going dry). Slow roast 12 hours (Note 8) – Roast; uncovered; for 12 hours; or until the internal temperature reaches 95°C/203°F and the meat falls apart effortlessly using two forks. ⚠️ Make sure your oven does not automatically turn off mid cook; many have auto-off functions that kick in at 12 hours (also factor in oven pre-heating time)! Shred – Transfer the pork to a large pan (reserve juices in roasting pan). Rest for 20 minutes then shred with tongs / forks – it will be effortless! You can discard the fat cap at this stage if you want. I leave some; it makes the shredded pork even juicier. Sauce it – Pour 3/4 cup of the juices from the roasting pan and 1 cup of Barbecue Sauce (see below) over the pork; and toss. Serve Pulled Pork with remaining Barbecue Sauce on the side so people can help themselves. Either make a big Southern feast with a side of cornbread; coleslaw and potato salad or macaroni salad. Or make Pulled Pork buns with soft rolls stuffed with coleslaw; Pulled Pork and the BBQ sauce! Place ingredients in a large saucepan and whisk to combine. Simmer 45 minutes: Bring to simmer on medium heat; then reduce to a low simmer for 45 minutes. Stir occasionally. Add pork juices: When the pork is cooked; add 1/2 cup of the juices from the roasting pan into the BBQ sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. Use water to control thickness – it should have a thick syrupy consistency. Serve warm or at room temperature (not fridge cold).
https://www.recipetineats.com/custard-cake-with-blueberries/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) with the shelf in the middle of the oven.  Grease a 20 cm / 8" springform pan with butter. Line the base and sides with paper. Heat milk: Heat the milk with vanilla and half the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat until hot. Whisk egg: Whisk yolks with remaining sugar; then whisk in the cornflour. Milk into egg: Slowly pour about 1/2 cup hot milk into the eggs while whisking. Once incorporated; pour in remaining milk and whisk to combine. Thicken: Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook on medium; whisking constantly until you feel it starting to thicken then immediately turn down to low (2 – 3 minutes). Keep whisking then when you see a lazy bubble appear and burst on the surface; whisk for 30 seconds longer. Enrichen with butter: Take off the stove. Whisk in butter until smooth. Scrape into a bowl then cover with cling wrap touching surface. Leave to cool while making the batter (Note 5 for custard tips) Batter: Whisk Wet ingredients in a large bowl. Add the Dry ingredients then whisk until smooth. Remove 1/3 cup of the batter (Note 5) then pour the remaining batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. (Bake the 1/3 cup batter in a separate greased ramekin for 25 minutes). Custard topping: Whisk custard until smooth. Dollop half around the edges of the cake surface then spread inwards with offset knife. Smooth the surface; then scatter with half the blueberries. Mix remaining blueberries into remaining custard; then spread across the cake surface; pressing blueberries in to flatten the surface. Bake 45 minutes: Place the cake in the oven and bake for 35 minutes. Remove; then use 2 small paring knives to burst some of the blueberries on the surface (1 knife to stop blueberry spinning; the other to burst). Limit bursting time to 1 minute; no longer! Then bake for a further 10 minutes. Cool: Remove cake from the oven. Fully cool in the cake pan (around 3 hours). Then refrigerate for 12 hours; still in the pan. Serve! Remove cake from the pan then cut into slices. Best served at room temperature rather than fridge cold!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-rissoles-chicken-patties/, Pre-heat oven to 100°C/210°F (all oven types); to keep cooked rissoles warm. Place a rack over a tray. Rissole mixture: Mix all ingredients together in a bowl using a wooden spoon. Form patties: Wet your hands (stops the mixture sticking all over your hands). Measure out just shy of 1/4 cup and shape into a 6 cm wide x 1.5cm thick pattie (2.4" x 0.6" thick). See Note 1 if your mixture is too loose. Cook: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large non-stick pan over medium high heat. Cook 5 – 6 rissoles at the time; 3 to 4 minutes on each side; until beautifully golden (as pictured).

https://www.recipetineats.com/vegetable-dumplings-potstickers/, Wilt cabbage 20 min; squeeze. Soak mushrooms 30 min; squeeze; finely chop. Mix with remaining Filling ingredients. Wrap. Pan fry 2 min; 1/4 cup water; pan-steam 5 min. Prepare cabbage – Toss cabbage with 1/2 tsp salt in a bowl. Set aside for 20 minutes. Then grab handfuls and squeeze out excess water as best you can. Place squeezed cabbage in a bowl for mixing the filling in. Shiitake mushrooms – Soak mushrooms in 1 litre of boiling water for 30 minutes. Squeeze out excess liquid and finely chop into 2 mm pieces. Add to the filling bowl. Potato – Add grated potatoes to filling mix; including all the liquid that leached out when you grated it. We want all that starchy juice for its binding power! Filling – Add remaining ingredients into the filling bowl; mix to combine. It will look crumbly – don't worry; everything sticks together better when steamed thanks to the potato. Dumpling wrappers – Take one wrapper from the packet. Keep unused wrappers covered so they don't dry out. Wrap dumplings – (See video at 1m 30s!) Place a wrapper in your non-dominant hand. Dip your index finger in water and run it along the lower half of the wrapper (edge closest to you). Place 1 loosely-packed tablespoon of filling in the centre. Fold the wrapping over the filling; then seal with pleats. (If this is too hard; skip the pleats and seal flat). Finished dumplings – Stand dumpling upright with the pleats on top; and lightly press down to flatten the base. Shape gently into a slight curve. Place on a tray lightly dusted with cornflour/cornstarch. Repeat for remaining dumplings. Keep completed dumplings covered with a tea towel to prevent them from drying out. If you're making ahead; cover dumplings with cling wrap and refrigerate. See storage notes. Cooking vessel: Use a large non-stick pan with a lid (Note 6). Pan fry: Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium high heat. Pan fry 12 to 15 dumplings for 2 minutes until the base is golden brown. Steam: Pour over 1/4 cup water over the dumplings in the skillet – it will steam and bubbly vigorously! Place the lid on and steam for 5 minutes or until the water in the pan has evaporated. Cooked! Remove the lid. The water should have been driven off; and the wrapping should be semi-transparent (indicating it is cooked). The base should be crispy again. If not; leave the pan uncovered for a bit until the base crisps up again in the oil. Serve: Scoop the dumplings up with a spatula and place on a serving plate. Serve with soy sauce and chili paste for dipping; or rice vinegar mixed with soy sauce. Best served fresh – I get another batch cooking as we eat the freshly cooked ones! Using either a bamboo steamer set over a large wok with simmering water; or other larger steamer. Line with a fitted sheet of parchment paper with holes; and steam the dumplings for 8 minutes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mega-italian-salad/, Croutons: Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Toss bread with oil and salt. Spread on a tray and bake 15 minutes; stirring twice; until golden and fully crisp. Cool on tray. Dressing: Shake ingredients in a jar. Make salad: Set aside some parmesan for garnish.

https://www.recipetineats.com/charlottes-hazelnut-olive-oil-cake/, Preheat oven to 170°C / 340°F (150°C fan). Grease a 20 cm/8" springform pan with olive oil then line with baking paper (parchment paper); then grease the paper. (Note 6) Dry ingredients: In a medium bowl; mix the hazelnut meal; baking soda; lemon and salt. Beat wet ingredients: In a large bowl; beat the olive oil; eggs and sugar for 2 to 3 minutes on speed 7 of a handheld beater or until it becomes pale and thick (like pouring cream). Add vanilla and beat on speed 1 for 10 seconds. Mix in dry: Add the Dry ingredients and mix in gently using a rubber spatula. Bake 45 minutes: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 minutes. It will puff up dramatically in the oven but it collapses as it cools. Cool: Remove from the oven and allow the cake to fully cool in the pan before releasing from the springform pan. This is a rustic cake that has higher edges and a flatter centre. Perfect proportions; I say: plenty of meringue-like edges and not an overwhelming amount of the rich brownie-like centre of the cake! Decorate: Sprinkle with hazelnuts and dust with icing sugar; if desired. Serve fully cool.
https://www.recipetineats.com/saltimbocca/, Pound: Place the veal between sheets of cling wrap or paper. Pound to an even 3mm thickness using a meat mallet (Note 5 for tips!) Cut each piece in half so you have 4 pieces in total; and sprinkle both sides with pepper. Prosciutto and sage: Fold a slice of prosciutto in half then place on one piece of veal (trim if needed so it's not hanging off the sides too much). Place a sage leaf on top then secure with a toothpick; piercing from the underside (see step photos or video). Do the same with the other piece of veal. Dust: Spread flour on a plate. Press the non-prosciutto side of the veal into the flour; shaking off excess (do not flour the prosciutto side). First side 1 1/2 minutes: Heat oil in a large fry pan over medium-high heat. Place veal slices in the pan; prosciutto-side down; and cook for 90 seconds until prosciutto is beautifully golden. Other side 1 min:Turn veal and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove to a warm plate. Tip out excess oil (do not scrape pan clean however). Return skillet to stove; with heat still on. Reduce wine: Pour in wine (careful; it will be steamy!) plus pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer then let it cook for 20 to 30 seconds; stirring to scrape up the brown fond from the base of the pan; until wine is reduced by half. Swirl butter: Keep the pan on the stove but turn the stove OFF. Scatter the butter in the pan then swirl (or stir) until it melts. The clear liquid will thicken magically into a luscious butter sauce! Divide veal between plates. Spoon over sauce. Devour! (Careful of the toothpick!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/red-vietnamese-fried-rice/, Melt most of the butter in a large non-stick skillet over high heat (save a dab for scrambling eggs). Add garlic; cook for 10 seconds. Add ham; stir for 30 seconds. Add peas; stir for 30 seconds. Rice and tomato paste – Add rice and tomato paste; cook for 2 minutes. Sauces – Add fish sauce; soy and sugar; cook 1 minute to get a bit of nice caramelisation on the tomatoey rice. Scramble eggs – Push rice to one side of the pan. In the cleared space; melt reserved butter then pour in the egg and scramble until just set. Serve – Toss cooked egg through the rice. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/french-fries/, Cut: Peel the potatoes. Cut into 6 mm / 1/4" French fries using a serrated knife. (Note 4) Keep cut fries submerged in a bowl of water to prevent them from going brown while you cut the remainder. (No need for actual soaking beyond this.) Rinse: Transfer potatoes to a colander and rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds. Simmer: Place fries in a large pot with 2 litres/quarts of cold tap water; vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then immediately reduce stove to low so the surface is rippling gently (Note 5); not big bubbles. Cook for 10 minutes then carefully remove using a slotted spoon into a colander (do not tip into colander; fries will break). Dry 5 min: Spread the fries on 2 tea towel lined trays. Leave to steam dry for 5 minutes. Pot: Pour 3 cm / 1.2" of oil in a pot that is at least 10cm/4" high (⚠️for safety; need at least 7 cm / 3" from oil surface to rim of pot; Note 6) Separate the fries into 3 Batches (for cooking). Heat oil to 205°C/400°F over medium high heat.  ⚠️10 sec pause (Note 7): Lower 1/3 of Batch 1 fries into the oil using a slotted spoon. WAIT 10 seconds; add another 1/3 of the fries; wait 10 seconds; then add the remaining Batch 1 fries.  50 sec fry: Fry for 50 seconds; moving them around once or twice. Then remove with a slotted spoon onto 2 paper towel lined trays; spread out in a single layer. The fries will still be white and floppy.  Repeat Fry #1 with Batches 2 and 3; ensuring the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before cooking. 30 min cool: Leaves fries to cool for 30 minutes. Line a large bowl with paper towels – for draining and tossing. Fry #2: Heat oil to 205°C/400°F. Fry half the French fries for 4 minutes; moving them around twice; or until golden brown and crispy. Drain in the lined bowl; then repeat with remaining fries. Sprinkle fries with salt or seasoning or choice. (Note 8) Toss and serve!  Fries will stay crispy even once cool. See note for large batch cooking tip.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fries-seasoning/, Mix the ingredients together. Sprinkle on fries to taste. Store any leftovers in an airtight container or jar in the pantry. Also great on roast potatoes; vegetables and proteins (use for cooking or sprinkle as a finishing salt).
https://www.recipetineats.com/rosemary-salt/, Prep: Place a sheet of paper towel on a heatproof plate. Spread rosemary on the paper towel; then cover with another single sheet of paper towel. Microwave in 4 x 30 second increments on high until the rosemary leaves are fully dry and can be crumbled into powder between your fingers; but still a lovely vibrant green! (Note 2 for oven) Grind into a coarse powder in a mortar and pestle (or even with your fingers). Goal: some fine powder and some coarse little rosemary bits. Mix: Measure out 3 teaspoons of the rosemary powder and mix in a small bowl with the salt. Use: Sprinkle on homemade fries; cooked proteins; use in place of plain salt in cheese muffins; on focaccia and in salad dressings! Best used uncooked as the rosemary is susceptible to burning. Store in an airtight container in the pantry.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheeseburger-recipe/, Patties: Separate the beef into 4 equal portions; or 8 if making double cheeseburgers (do it!). Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide; 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun). Prepare: Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat). Toast buns: Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ; place cut face down on the grill). Set aside. Dent patty: Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip; then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper. Preheat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot – smoking hot! (Note 6)  Cook: Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip; then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes. Preheat: If your BBQ hot plate/grill is well seasoned (ie oiled); there is no need to oil before cooking. If not; lightly brush with vegetable or canola oil (or use scrunched up paper towel). Then preheat your BBQ on high until very hot and you see wisps of smoke. Cook the burgers per above directions for 1 1/2 minutes on each side; topping with cheese as soon as you flip; then resting for 3 minutes. (You can also toast the buns on the grill (face down on the grills; 2 – 3 minutes.) Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce; tomato; burger (x 2 for double!); gherkins; onion; sauce on bun lid; jam it on top of the stack.  DEVOUR with French Fries on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/special-burger-sauce/, Combine all ingredients in a small bowl or jug and stir until smooth. Use for burgers – browse my Burger collection or try the latest and greatest Cheeseburger! I generously slather on the base bun as well as the lid (or drizzle the stack). 
https://www.recipetineats.com/quick-tomato-chutney-burger-sauce/, Mix all the ingredients in a medium saucepan. Simmer Bring to a simmer over medium heat then lower heat to medium low so it's simmering gently. Cook for 25 minutes; stirring regularly; until it reduces down and is thick enough so you can draw a path across the base of the saucepan (see video or step photos). Cool & slather: Transfer into a bowl. For use on burgers; cool then slather. Browse my Burger collection for options! If using to dollop or dip for any number of the other suggested uses in the post; use warm or cooled!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-avocado-ranch-pasta-salad/, Pre-heat the oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan-forced). Bacon: Place bacon slices on a rack set on an oven tray. Bake 20 minutes or until deep golden and crispy; then remove from the oven and let it cool – it will get crispier. Then chop into 1 cm / 1/3" pieces. Pound chicken: Cover chicken with baking paper then pound to 1.5 cm / 3/5" even thickness using a meat mallet; rolling pin or cast iron pan. Season: Mix the paprika; salt and pepper in a small bowl. Place chicken on a baking tray; drizzle then rub with half the oil. Sprinkle with seasoning; then repeat on the other side. Bake the chicken for 12 minutes or until the internal temperature is 67°C/153°F. Remove from the tray and rest for 5 minutes then cut into 4 x 1cm / 2.5 x 1/2" pieces. Bring a large pot of water to the boil then add the 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per the packet time plus 2 minutes (Note 5). Drain; rinse under water then leave to drain well and cool. 9 minutes: Bring a large saucepan of water to boil. Lower eggs in using a slotted spoon then start the timer for 9 minutes. Reduce stove heat so eggs are not bouncing around so much that the shells crack. Peel in cold water: Remove eggs using a slotted spoon into a large bowl or sink of cold water (iced water is best; but I never waste ice on eggs!). Leave for 5 minutes then peel while submerged under water; it's easier. Pat dry then cut eggs into quarters. Place all ingredients except the dill into a container just large enough to fit the head of a stick blender. Blitz until the avocado is smooth. Add dill and jus blitz to mix through. Taste and adjust salt; if needed. Place the pasta and dressing in a very large bowl along with everything else EXCEPT the eggs. Toss gently to combine. Add eggs; then toss gently to disperse. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-baked-chicken-drumsticks/, Preparation: Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan-forced). Line a tray with foil then place a rack on the tray (makes the underside of the drumsticks crispier; Note 4). Seasoning: Mix the Seasoning ingredients in a shallow bowl. Coat in oil: Toss the drumsticks in the olive oil. Stretch and pull the skin on each drumsticks to cover as much of the flesh as possible. Coat in seasoning: Coat a drumstick in the Seasoning then shake the excess off well. Place on the rack. Repeat with remaining drumsticks. Spray with oil: Spray the legs generously with oil.  Bake for 30 minutes; rotating the tray halfway through. Increase the oven to 220°C / 430°F (200°C fan) then bake for a further 15 minutes or until the skin is crispy. Enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/brownies-fudgey-easy-gluten-free/, Preheat the oven to 180°C / 325°F (160°C fan-forced) with a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preparation: Grease and line a 20cm / 8" square pan with baking paper (parchment paper) with excess overhang so it's easy to lift out the brownie when cooked. Melt butter and chocolate: Place chocolate; butter and salt in a heatproof bowl. Microwave in 3 x 30 second bursts on high; mixing in between; until melted and smooth. You could also do this over simmering water on the stove. Cool 5 minutes: Mix well to combine the chocolate and butter then leave to cool for 5 minutes.  Add vanilla; sugar and eggs: Stir in the vanilla and sugar. Crack the eggs straight into the bowl; and stir until combined. Add dry: Add almond meal and rice flour; and mix very well until fully combined. Bake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 25 minutes or until the brownies are slightly puffed all over and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out moist but clean. You want it to be moist! Cool and serve: Cool brownies for at least 30 minutes in the pan. Remove the brownie by holding the edges of the baking paper; fully cool on a rack. Then cut into squares (3 x 3 for gigantic ones; 4 x 4 for sensible ones).  See Note 4 for more cutting tips.
https://www.recipetineats.com/immunity-boosting-green-goddess-soup-its-delish/, Sauté aromatics: Heat oil in a very large pot (6L/qt) over medium high heat. Cook onion; leek; celery; garlic and fennel for 5 minutes until softened. Cook spices: Add all spice and cumin; and cook for 1 minute. Add water; potatoes; broccoli; salt and pepper. Stir; bring to simmer; and simmer for 7 minutes (no lid) until the broccoli is tender. Add peas: Add peas; simmer for 1 minute. Blitz in kale: Remove pot off the stove. Add kale; push it under the liquid; then blitz with a stick blender until mostly smooth. Add spinach; push under the liquid then blitz again until smooth as possible (approx 3 to 5 mins). This will result in a smooth soup but with little green bits in it – I like this for a little texture.  Serve: Stir in cream. Ladle into bowls;  drizzle with extra cream and/or olive oil and finish with a sprinkle of sunflower seeds. Eat and feel great!
https://www.recipetineats.com/my-favourite-tomato-salad/, Cut the tomatoes into 8 or 10 wedges; cutting out the core. Place in a large bowl. Sprinkle over eschallots; garlic; salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar. Gently toss to coat tomatoes. Add basil; toss again to disperse. Pour into bowl and serve immediately! (Tip: Bread for mopping up the tomato juices is on point).
https://www.recipetineats.com/teriyaki-salmon-noodles/, Teriyaki Sauce: Mix the ingredients in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Coat salmon with 1 tablespoon of Teriyaki Sauce in a bowl; then set aside while you cook the noodles. (No need to marinate) Cook your noodles per the packet directions. Drain; briefly rinse under tap water then set aside. Cook salmon: Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat. Cook the salmon for 1 1/2 minutes on each side or until golden; then remove to a plate. Pour any remaining sauce in the skillet over the salmon. Cook aromatics: Roughly clean the pan with a paper towel then return to the stove; still on high heat. Heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil and cook the onion and garlic for 30 seconds. Add Chinese broccoli stems and cook for 1 minute. Noodles & sauce: Add noodles and half the Sauce. Toss for 2 minutes until the Sauce is absorbed. Add the remaining Sauce and toss to disperse. Then spread the noodles out in the pan; cook for 30 seconds un-disturbed. Repeat again 3 to 4 times (~3 min total) – a trick for nice caramelisation on the noodles (which = flavour!). Leafy greens: Drizzle the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil around the side of the pan; then add the Chinese broccoli leaves. Toss for a further 1 1/2 minutes or until the leaves wilt. Add back salmon: Remove pan from stove. Place salmon on top; break into large chunks then toss through. Serve: Divide between bowls and serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/honey-cake/, Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Prepare cake pan: Butter and line a 20cm/8" round pan or springform pan with baking paper (base and sides). Whisk Dry ingredients: Whisk together the flour; baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Cream butter and honey: In a separate bowl; cream the butter and honey for 3 minutes; scraping down the sides halfway; until smooth and fluffy. (Speed 7 handheld beater or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment). Add eggs and flour – Add one egg; mix with a wooden spoon for 30 seconds until mostly incorporated into the batter (mixture will looked curdled). Then add in 1/4 of the flour and mix until the batter comes together. Repeat again – mixing in 1 egg; then a portion of flour – until you've used all the eggs. Milk and zest: Stir in the milk and orange zest; stir until the batter is almost completely smooth. The batter should be quite thick; but soft. Bake 45 min: Scrape batter into the prepared pan; smooth the surface and sprinkle with almonds. Bake for 45 minutes or until a knife inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool 30 min: Remove cake from the oven. Cool for 30 minutes in the pan – don’t skip this else the cake gets too dense when soaked with syrup.  Honey Syrup: Meanwhile; make the syrup. Bring the honey and water to a gentle boil for 5 minutes over medium-low heat. Add the lemon juice and boil for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat; cool for 10 minutes then use per below. Poke and soak: Poke about 30 holes all across the surface using a skewer (between the almond flakes). Pour 1/4 of the warm Honey Syrup across the surface (if using a springform pan; put it on a plate in case it leaks). Once it mostly sinks in; repeat 3 more times; waiting between pours for the syrup to soak in. Then leave the cake to soak for 15 minutes. Serve: Serve warm. Remove the springform pan sides; or serve it straight out of the cake pan (Note 4 for removing from cake pan). I typically serve it plain. However Topping Options suggested above would never be turned away!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-tagine/, Plump apricots – Soak the dried apricots in a bowl of boiling water for 30 minutes; then drain (this plumps them up). Season chicken – Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with the salt. Brown chicken – Heat oil the oil in a large; deep skillet or pot (Note 5) over high heat. Place chicken in the skillet skin side down and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until deep golden. Turn and cook the flesh side for 1 minute then remove to a plate.

Simmer uncovered 20 minutes – Remove lid then cook for a further 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken is at least 70°C/158°F (Note 6). Serve – Remove from stove and rest for 5 minutes. Serve over couscous (Note 9); sprinkled with fresh coriander.
https://www.recipetineats.com/supreme-soy-noodles/, Mix Sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Cook noodles per packet directions (see cooking tip in Notes). Drain and give it a quick rinse under tap water to stop them sticking together as they sit. Sauté garlic – Heat oil in a large deep non-stick skillet or wok over high heat. Add white part of green onions; stir for 20 seconds. Add garlic and stir for 10 seconds or until light golden. Add noodles; sauce – Add noodles then pour over Sauce. Toss for 1 1/2 minutes. Don’t skimp on this step; the flavour is so much better when the noodles caramelise slightly. If your stove is a bit weak; you might need to go longer! Green onions – Add green onion and toss until just wilted; about 20 seconds. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-sharwama-middle-eastern/, Marinade chicken – Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag.

https://www.recipetineats.com/vegetarian-pasta-salad/, Place ingredients in a jar and shake well. Set aside 10 minutes+. Preheat oven to 250°C/480°F (230°F fan) – super high heat replicates BBQ charred edges. Toss veggies in oil – Place all vegetables other than asparagus in a large bowl. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt; pepper and garlic; toss. Spread vegetables on 2 trays (fill one less than the other). Roast 25 minutes; tossing once. Add asparagus – Drizzle asparagus with oil and pinch of salt and pepper. Add into oven for last 5 minutes. BBQ Option: See Marinated BBQ Vegetables for directions. Marinate veggies – Transfer vegetables into large bowl; pour over 1/2 the Dressing. Toss; then leave to marinate for 30 minutes to 3 hours. Cook pasta + 2 minutes: In large pot of salted water; cook pasta per packet directions but ADD 2 minutes to the cook time (Note 5 for why). Drain and return pasta into pot.  Add vegetables; including veg juices; into the pasta pot. Add remaining Dressing and parsley; then toss. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool slightly. Serve! Sprinkle with feta and serve! Keeps 4 – 5 days; serve at room temp. SCOOP OUT a mug of pasta cooking water just before draining. Add 3 tbsp water to reserved Dressing (after marinating veg); shake well. Use this Dressing per above; but reserve 3 tbsp to freshen up pasta salad on Day 2 onwards. Freshen up pasta salad: Bring to room temp or briefly microwave (cold pasta = dry) to warm gently. Toss with Reserved Dressing then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-brie-with-maple-syrup-thyme/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Unwrap brie and place in a small; shallow ovenproof dish slightly larger than the brie (to be used for serving) OR a piece of crumbled baking / parchment paper (for transference). (Note 2) Oven: Bake for 15 to 20 minutes (for 250g/80z); or until melted through. For 500g/1lb brie; increase to 25 minutes.  To check; gently touch the centre of the brie – it should feel very soft; like it is about to collapse if you press any harder. Microwave option: 2 minutes on high (no one will know!) in 30 second increments. Carefully transfer to serving plate / board – it's delicate (transfer on paper if you used paper). Drizzle with honey; top with sprig of thyme (if using). Serve immediately with crostini on the side for scooping. Provide a knife to cut through the rind and a cheese or pate knife (or similar) to scoop cheese up onto crostini or crackers (plain or fruit/nut flavoured).

https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-maple-sticky-glazed-ham/, Take ham out of fridge 1 hour prior. Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (140°C fan). Arrange shelf in lower third so the ham will be sitting in the centre of the oven (rather than in top half of oven). Place the Glaze ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined – use whisk if needed. Run small knife around bone handle; down each side of the ham; and under the rind on the cut face. (See video & photos in post) Slide fingers under the rind on the cut face of the ham; and run them back and forth to loosen while pulling the rind back. Use knife if needed to slice off any residual rind. Lightly cut 2.5cm / 1" diamonds across the fat surface of the ham; about 75% of the way into the fat. Avoid cutting into the meat. Insert a clove in the intersection of the cross of each diamond on the surface (optional). Place the ham in a large baking dish. Prop handle up on edge of pan + scrunched up foil so surface of the ham is level (for more even caramelisation). Squeeze the juice of 1 orange (4 quarters) over the ham. Then place them along with the remaining orange into the baking dish around the ham. Brush / spoon half the glaze all over the surface and cut face of the ham (don't worry about underside; glaze drips down into pan) Pour the water in the baking dish; then place in the oven. Bake for 1.5 – 2 hrs; basting very generously every 30 minutes with remainig glaze + juices in pan; or until sticky and golden. Use foil patches to protect bits that brown faster than others – press on lightly; caramelisation won't peel off with the foil. Allow to rest for at least 20 minutes before serving. Baste; baste; baste before serving – as the glaze in the pan cools; it thickens which means it "paints" the ham even better – but be sure to save pan juices for drizzling.  My favourite sauce: Use pan juices as the sauce – it's loaded with flavour! Pour into a jug and warm so it's pourable. Thin slightly with water if required. Drizzle sparingly as the glaze flavour is intense!  Other condiments: Dijon mustard; wholegrain mustard; onion jam; tomato chutney; cranberry sauce. Presentation: Wrap handle with baking paper and ribbon if desired. Remove cloves. Cover serving platter with lots of green fluffage; then place ham on. Surround with more quartered oranges; for colour. Let people admire before carving! Serving: Personal preference whether to serve at room temp or warm; I like either. I also like to drizzle with pan juices – it looks messier but tastes fabulous. Slice thinly! I start slicing at the table; then finish it in the kitchen (towards end when it gets messy!) Leftovers: See list in post for recipe using leftover ham and ham bone!  Storing: Will keep for at least a week in the fridge if properly stored using a water-vinegar soaked ham bag or pillowcase. Otherwise freeze – don't forget the bone! See How to Store Glazed Ham for directions.

https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-cookies-vanilla-biscuits/, Preheat Oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl until creamy (1 minute on speed 5) Add egg and vanilla; beat until completely combined. Add flour; baking powder; and salt. Start mixing slowly; then beat until the flour is incorporated – it will be clumpy. Dust work surface with flour; scrape dough out of bowl. Pat together then cut in half; then shape into 2 discs. Roll out to 0.3cm / 1/8" (for thinner; crispier cookies) or 0.6cm / 1/4" (for thicker; softer cookies); sprinkling with flour under and over the dough so it doesn't stick. Use cookie cutters to press out shapes and use a knife or spatula to transfer shapes to prepared baking sheets. (Keep dough that doesn’t fit in the oven in the fridge). Bake for 10 minutes; swapping trays halfway (Note 2); until the surface is pale golden and the edges are just beginning to turn light golden. Allow cookies to cool completely on trays (they will finish cooking on the trays). Icing – see Icing for Christmas Cookies recipe. Melt chocolate then dip the surface into chocolate. Dot with icing sugar and decorated with silver balls Dust with icing sugar Serve plain! They are sweet vanilla biscuits so they are wonderful eaten just as they are!
https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-baked-salmon/, Mix ingredients in a bowl until smooth. Keep refrigerated until required. Plump cranberries: Heat orange juice in a saucepan over high heat until hot. Turn stove off; add cranberries; cover. Stand 15 minutes; then drain in a colander (discard liquid). Cool. Mix: Mix cranberries; toasted almonds (see Note 3); parsley; salt and olive oil in bowl. Use at room temp. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Prepare salmon: Place a large sheet of foil on a tray (double layer for safety is recommended); then top with baking/parchment paper. Place salmon on paper; then fold up the foil sides a bit to cup them so glaze won't run onto tray. Glaze: Place ingredients in a saucepan over medium high heat. Once it started foaming; turn down to medium; let it foam for 2 minutes then remove and pour straight over the salmon. Season: Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper; putting most of the salt on the thicker part of the salmon. Wrap: Cover salmon with a smaller piece of paper; then foil. Fold and seal up sides to enclose salmon in a parcel – it doesn't need to be 100% tightly sealed. Bake 15 minutes. Remove salmon from oven. Uncover / fold excess paper – Remove paper and foil and paper cover. Fold/scrunch paper and foil sides down to expose salmon surface. Tucking paper down also ensures it won't catch fire when broiling. Grill/broil to brown: Switch oven to grill/broiler on high. Place salmon on middle shelf in the oven and broil 7 to 10 minutes until you get caramelisation mostly on the edges; a bit on top. Don't put it too close to the heat element otherwise paper might catch on fire! Check to ensure salmon is cooked – either pry open in middle to check or use a probe to check internal temperatures (Note 4). Transfer to plate: Use foil overhang to transfer salmon onto serving platter straight away (otherwise it keeps cooking). Slide the foil then paper out from under the salmon (see video at 1 min 24s or step photos in post); allowing juices to pool on platter (it's gold stuff!). Cool: Loosely cover with foil; then leave to cool for at least 15 minutes; up to 1 hour or longer (for room temp serving – Note 6 for serving notes). Dollop then thickly spread with Creamy Dill Sauce (~0.8cm / 1/3" thick layer).  Pile over Holiday Tapenade; scatter generously with pomegranate seeds; and then remaining parsley. Squeeze over lemon juice. Serving: Serve with extra lemon wedges so people can add more to taste. Cut into pieces – I use a cake cutter for serving. Encourage people to slop up some of the honey-butter sauce that will be mixed with semi melted Creamy Dill Sauce – it's so good! This dish is best served slightly warm; not piping hot; also excellent at room temp.
https://www.recipetineats.com/standing-rib-roast/, Bring Beef to room temp: Take beef out of the fridge 2 – 3 hours before cooking to bring to room temp (key tip for even cooking). Pat dry with paper towel. Preheat oven to 240°C/460°F (220°C fan). Adjust shelf so beef will be sitting in the middle of the oven. Garlic Herb Butter: Mix together. Roasting bed: Place onion; garlic and herbs in a heavy based oven proof skillet (or use a roasting pan). Slather 1: Spread a thin layer of butter on the underside of the beef (ie the bone side). Place beef on onion etc; butter side down. Spread about 2/3 of the butter on the top and sides (reserve some for Slather 2). Hot oven: Roast 20 minutes. Slather 2: Remove; spread over remaining butter. Turn oven down to 120°C/250°F (100°C fan). Slow roast: Roast for a further 1 1/2 hours; basting every 30 minutes with the juices in the pan; until the internal temperature is 51°C / 123.8°F in the centre (for medium rare; Note 4). Start checking the internal temp early. Rest: Transfer beef to plate. Cover loosely with foil and rest for 20 – 30 minutes. Internal temperature will rise to 56-58°C / 133-136.4°F (which is medium rare). Slice beef and serve with Sauce! For a classic high-end Steakhouse experience; serve with Paris Mash and Garlic Sautéed Spinach. Place skillet with onion and garlic left in it on the stove over high heat. Add wine and beef stock; rapidly simmer for 10 minutes until it reduces by 2/3 or so; down to 1 1/2 cups or liquid. Lower heat to medium. Mix cornflour with 2 tbsp water. Drizzle in half and stir. Sauce will thicken in 1 minute or so. Add more cornflour water mixture if you want it thicker. Strain into bowl; pour into sauce jug.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mexican-corn-salad/, Cut off kernels: Cut the corn off the cob (see photo in post  or video for how I do this without getting corn everywhere!) If using frozen; do not thaw. Brown corn: Melt butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and stir for 10 seconds. Add corn and cook for 5 minutes; stirring every now and then; until you get lovely golden brown bits and the corn is cooked and sweet (don't stir constantly; harder to brown). Season corn: Add salt and pepper halfway through cooking corn. Toss with dressing: Transfer corn into large bowl. Add mayonnaise; sour cream; lime juice and parmesan. Toss well to combine – heat will "melt" dressing. Add coriander/cilantro; red onion; green onion and jalaepno. Toss again. Serve: Transfer to serving bowl. Crumble over cotija/feta and garnishes of choice. Serve warm or at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-mac-and-cheese/, Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.

Then add remaining milk and mix until lump free (use whisk if required). Add Seasonings: Mix in salt and Seasonings if using. Thicken sauce: Cook; stirring/whisking regularly; for 5 – 8 minutes until thickened to a cream consistency. When the Sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon; you should be able to draw a path with your finger. Add cheese: Remove from stove; add cheese and stir – cheese doesn't need to melt. Check salt: Adjust salt to taste (if you use recommended cheeses; you won't need more). Assemble: Pour Sauce into pot with Macaroni. Stir quickly; then pour back into the skillet (I did this) or a baking dish (Note 4). Sprinkle with breadcrumb topping. Bake for 25 minutes or until top is light golden. Don't bake too long otherwise you'll bake away the Sauce! Serve: Serve immediately! I sprinkled mine with a bit of fresh parsley. See notes for best make-ahead method.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheesy-potato-gratin-stacks-muffin-tin/, Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C (all oven types).

Try to match by size to make them into neat stacks. Cream: Drizzle each potato stack with 1 tsp of cream mixture – use 1/2 of the mixture. Cheese slice: Top with cheese slice. Top with potato; cream then thyme: Top each stack with remaining potato slices so the height is about 1cm / 1/3" above the rim of the muffin tin (they sink once baked). Drizzle with remaining cream mixture and sprinkle with most of the thyme (reserve some for topping). Baked 40 minutes: Cover loosely with foil and bake for 40 minutes or until potato is cooked through. A small sharp knife should go through without any resistance. Top with cheese; bake 10 minutes: Remove from oven; sprinkle with shredded cheese and bake without foil for 10 minutes or until golden. Garnish with thyme: Sprinkle with remaining thyme. Stand 5 minutes then remove to serve. Use a tablespoon or butter knife to help scope them out. (Note 3) To Serve: Dinner – serve as a side. Finger food – serve warm as is.

https://www.recipetineats.com/bangers-and-mash-sausage-with-onion-gravy/, Cook sausages: Heat oil in a large skillet / fry pan over medium high heat. Add sausages and cook; turning; until browned as much as possible all over and cooked through. Cook time will differ depending on sausage size – mine take around 8 minutes. Remove sausages onto a plate. Turn heat down to medium. 2 tbsp oil remaining: You need around 2 tbsp oil left in the skillet. If you have much less; add a bit of butter or oil. Saute onion and garlic: Add onion and garlic; cook until golden brown – around 4 minutes. Cook off flour 2 minutes: Add flour and mix through. Then cook; stirring constantly for 2 minutes. Gradually add beef stock: Add about 3/4 cup of beef broth and mix into the onion so it becomes a sludge. Then add remaining beef broth and mix until combined. If it's lumpy; use a whisk to help make it smooth. Thicken gravy: Simmer; stirring; for 2 to 3 minutes until the gravy thickens but is slightly thinner than you want – it will thicken more as you serve it.  Season: Add salt and pepper. Stir; taste; then add more salt if you want. Serve sausages with plenty of gravy; with mashed potato and peas on the side. (Low carb option – Creamy Cauliflower Mash)
https://www.recipetineats.com/blueberry-lemon-loaf/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan forced). Line loaf pan: Butter and line a loaf pan with parchment / baking paper. I used a 21 x 11 x 7 cm pan (8.3 x 4.5 x 2.75") which makes a nice tall loaf. Coat blueberries: Toss blueberries in flour (less flour sticks if dry; more if frozen). This helps keep them suspended in the batter. Whisk Dry ingredients in a bowl.  Add Wet ingredinets: Make a well in the Dry ingredients. Add Wet ingredients. Whisk until incorporated. Fold in blueberries: Fold in blueberries; including any flour remaining in the blueberry bowl. Bake: Pour into the prepared tin. Bake for 50 minutes; then cover with foil. Bake for a further 15 – 25 minutes; or until a skewer comes out clean. Check after 15 minutes; then if the skewer comes out with batter on it; bake a further 10 minutes. Cool: Rest for 5 minutes then turn onto a cooling rack and completely cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Wait until the glaze sets (about 20 minutes) before slicing to serve. Whisk icing sugar and lemon until smooth; using milk only if needed to achieve the right thickness (Note 3). Pour or spread over cake set on a rack over a baking tray. Scrape glaze drippings on the tray back onto the cake.
https://www.recipetineats.com/quick-broccoli-pasta/, Cook pasta: Boil a large pot of water with 2 tsp salt; add pasta. Chop broccoli: Chop broccoli into small florets. Cook broccoli: Add broccoli into water 1 – 2 minutes before pasta is cooked. Sauce ingredients in jar: Place Sauce ingredients in a jar with lid. Reserve pasta water: SCOOP OUT 1 cup pasta cooking water just before draining. Then drain and return pasta back into same pot on turned off stove. Add pasta water into Sauce: Add 1/2 cup pasta water to Pasta Sauce jar; shake well.  Add Sauce & Cheese to pasta: Pour Sauce and add cheese into pot with pasta. Stir then serve! Stir vigorously; adding more pasta water if required. Add more salt and pepper if required. Serve immediately; garnished with parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-vegetable-frittata/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Toss vegetables on tray with oil; garlic; herbs; salt and pepper. Spread out. Roast 25 minutes; undisturbed (no flipping). Remove and cool for at least 5 minutes before using. Lower oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Grease & line pan: Spray a 19 x 30cm / 8 x 10" rectangle or 22 cm / 9" square pan lightly with oil; then line with parchment paper with overhang. (Note 3) Egg mixture: Whisk eggs; cream; salt and pepper in a bowl. Assemble: Spread 2/3 of the vegetables in the prepared pan. Pour over egg mixture; sprinkle with cheese; then top with remaining vegetables. Topping: Top with crumbled feta; then mushrooms. Drizzle mushrooms with a touch of olive oil (makes it brown). Bake: Bake 40 minutes until centre is just set. Rest & serve: Rest frittata 5 minutes in the pan. Use paper overhang to lift out of pan; then slice into squares and serve. Serving later: Cool on rack and remove paper from underneath (otherwise base gets soggy). Cut then refrigerate up to 5 days; or freeze. Reheat in microwave.
https://www.recipetineats.com/ultimate-roast-lamb-12-hour-shoulder/, Preheat oven to 230°C / 450°F (210°C fan). Marinade/rub: Mix the Marinade ingredients in a small bowl. Rub all over the lamb surface; getting it right into all the cracks and crevices! Marinate 2 – 24 hrs: If time permits; marinate for 2 hours on the counter in a roasting pan; or up to 24 hours in the fridge. I skip this step more often than not; however. (Note 4) Prepare roasting pan: Scatter onion in the base of the roasting pan. Place lamb shoulder on top . Pour water into pan. Roast uncovered for 45 minutes. Slow-roast 12 hours: Turn oven down to 100°C/210°F (both fan and standard; Note 5). Cover lamb with baking paper; then a double layer of foil and seal very tightly to avoid water evaporation. Roast for 12 hours (I always do overnight!). Check meat – Test side of lamb with two forks. The meat should be fall-apart tender. If not; cover and return to oven. Remove lamb: There will (should!) be a lot of liquid pooled under the lamb in the roasting pan. Remove lamb to a large dish. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm. It will stay warm for 2 to 3 hours. See Note for reheating / making ahead. Reduce liquid: Strain all the liquid in the roasting pan into a saucepan (Note 2). Bring to a boil then simmer rapidly on medium-high until it reduces down to 1 cup (250ml). Thicken: Mix cornflour with water. Pour into jus in a thin stream while stirring continuously. Continue to cook for a minute or two over medium heat; stirring every now and then; until it thickens to a syrup consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve Slow Roasted Lamb with Jus. Use tongs for tearing meat off – no knife for carving needed! Pictured in post with Greek Lemon Roasted Potatoes; a perfect match for this Greek-ish flavoured lamb. Roasted Vegetables would also be ideal.
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-sauteed-green-beans/, Blanch beans: Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil with 1 teaspoon of salt. Add beans; cook for 4 minutes (they will turn bright green); drain; then rinse under cold tap water to cool. (There's really no need to shock in ice water). Shake off excess water. Sauté: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add green beans and garlic. Toss (or stir!) for 2 minutes until the garlic is golden and crispy. Add salt and pepper; then toss. Serve: Transfer beans to serving dish. Serve warm! Prepare ahead: Blanch beans per step 1; cool and dry; store in fridge until required. When ready to serve; just toss with garlic. It's an instant on-demand side!
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-cook-fish-with-crispy-skin/, Thick Fillets definition: Fish > 2.5cm / 1" thick at the thickest point. Best finished in the oven. (Note 3) Pan type: Non-stick pan; an oven proof one if you have Thick Fillets. (Note 4) Preheat oven (for Thick Fillets): Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Dry skin: Pat skin dry with paper towels. For extra precaution; leave the fish fillets in the fridge skin side up; uncovered; for an hour. (I rarely do this) Scoring skin (Note 5): For Thick Fillets; score the skin by cutting slashes into the skin as pictured in post. 4cm slashes 1cm apart; 2 – 3mm deep; through the skin and ever so slightly into the flesh (1.6" long; 0.4" apart; 0.1" deep) Season fish: Sprinkle the flesh and skin with the salt and pepper just before cooking. Heat oil well: Heat oil in a non stick pan over medium high heat until you see the first small wisps of smoke. Press fish down: Place one fillet into the pan skin side down; then use your fingers or spatula to press down lightly for 10 seconds to allow the skin to seal flat against the hot surface. Repeat with the other fillet (PROS: Do both at the same time!). Cook skin 2 – 3 minutes: Cook the skin side for 2 to 3 minutes until it's crispy in the centre and golden. Lift up to check. Transfer Thick Fillets to oven: Transfer to oven for 10 minutes (do not flip; keep skin side still down – goes crispier!) or until the internal temperature is 55°C/131°F. (Note 6)  Thin fillets: Turn and cook the flesh side in the pan. Rest 3 minutes: Transfer fish to a rack with the skin side UP. Rest for 3 minutes. Serving: To serve; place on a plate skin side UP. Do not pour sauce on the skin until just before serving else it will soften the fish skin. See ingredients above for suggested sauces and sides!
https://www.recipetineats.com/flan-patissier-french-custard-tart/, Infuse milk: Place milk; vanilla seeds; used beans and 50g (1/4 cup) sugar in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to just before boiling; stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat; place lid on and leave to steep for 10 minutes. Yolk mixture: Meanwhile; place egg yolks; egg and remaining sugar in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add cornflour and whisk until smooth. Temper eggs: While whisking the eggs; slowly pour in about half the milk in a thin stream. Whisk until combined. Thicken custard: Pour the egg-milk mixture back into the saucepan then whisk to combine. Place over medium low heat; stirring constantly so the base doesn't catch; until it starts to thicken (you will feel it). It should happen within 3 to 5 minutes. If it gets lumpy; remove off heat; whisk vigorously – will become smooth. Stir 20 seconds after bubbles appear: When the custard is thickened and hot and you see the first big lazy bubbles appear on the base; whisk constantly on the stove for a further 20 seconds then remove from stove. (To check for bubbles; pause stirring for a few seconds) Butter: Whisk butter in until fully incorporated. Strain & cool: Immediately strain into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer. Discard vanilla bean. Cover with cling wrap touching the surface. Cool on counter (3 hrs+) then refrigerate 12 – 24 hours. (Note 5) Work with pastry as frozen as possible – it's easier. (Note 4) Cut base and sides: Cut base out using the inside of the pan as a guide on one sheet of puff pastry. Cut three 25 x 5.5cm  (2.15 x 10″) wide strips on the other sheet of puff pastry.  Place base and sides back in freezer. RESERVE offcuts (for emergency patching). Line pan: Butter and line the sides of a 20cm/8" springform pan with a 5.5cm / 2.2" strip of baking paper. We are not using the pan base. (Note 6) Line sides: Place cake pan on a square sheet of baking paper on a plate. (Note 6) Remove cut puff pastry from freezer. Working quickly; when sides have JUST thawed enough to bend; line sides of cake pan with puff pastry; overlapping by 1cm / 0.4"; using water to seal – just press down for now (will seal properly later). Base: Brush base of sides with water. Fit base into cake pan (see video at 2 min 50 sec for technique). Seal pastry: Use the back of a teaspoon to press base into the corner. Then smear the now-thawing puff pastry to full seal. Prick base: Prick base 30 times with fork. (I always forget!!) Freeze: Cover with cling wrap; freeze 4 – 24 hours. (Note 4) Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan) for 30 minutes.  Line & fill with beads: Pick up crust using paper and place on tray (on the paper). Crumple 2 x 60cm / 2 feet long sheets of baking paper (Note 7) then fit into crust arranged in X. Fill with baking beads 1cm / 0.4" below rim (Note 8). Press to push paper into corners. Blind bake 25 min + 5 min: Bake 25 minutes; then use overhang paper to remove beads carefully (if sides look like they will cave in; return to oven with beads for 5 min). Bake 5 minutes then cool 10 minutes. (Seal any visible cracks with puff pastry scraps) Turn oven down to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Fill with custard: Remove Creme Patissiere from fridge. Whisk to loosen; scrape into crust – fill to 1cm/0.4" below rim. (Leftover custard Note 7) Smooth surface; brush custard surface with egg yolk (use it all). Bake 65 minutes; rotating tray 180° at 45 minutes. It will puff up in the last 15 ninutes like a souffle. Remove from oven – it will still be very wobbly; have faith! It will set when cool!Golden surface – If the top is not golden like pictured; switch on broiler to caramelise surface. Watch carefully – takes minutes! Cool on counter for 4 hours (in pan). Transfer to plate (still in pan); cover loosely with cling wrap; then refrigerate 12+ hours.  Serve: Remove from fridge 1 hour prior to serving to bring to room temperature. Cut into slices like cake! The pastry is crispy & flaky. The custard will cut neatly (it will not ooze) but when you bite into it; the custard is beautifully soft and creamy. Traditionally eaten as a hand held bakery treat in France but you can use a plate if you're feeling civilised! Shelf life: Flan Pâtissier is at its best in the first 24 hours after it is put in the fridge after baking as this is when the pastry is still beautifully crisp. Beyond this the pastry starts to soften which no one has pointed out yet because everyone is besotted by the custard! But I notice. 🙂
https://www.recipetineats.com/pearl-barley-soup/, Rinse barley in a colander with cold tap water. Leave to drain for several minutes. Sauté veg 5 minutes: Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; carrot; celery; swede; mushrooms and garlic (yes; all at once!). Cook for 5 minutes; stirring regularly. Sauté herbs/spices: Add thyme; coriander; fennel; bay leaves; salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Simmer 35 minutes: Add pearl barley and vegetable stock. Stir; bring to a boil and simmer for 35 minutes until barley is cooked. It will have a nice chew to it but should not have a hard centre like uncooked rice. Stir in parsley: Stir in parsley leaves. Ladle into bowls and serve! Strain soup (or use slotted spoon); store vegetables/barley separate from soup broth. Otherwise the barley will soak up all the liquid!
https://www.recipetineats.com/honey-prawns-stays-crispy/, Salt prawns: Mix prawns with salt. (Don't do this ahead; salt makes prawns sweat = compromise crispy coating!) Dust: Place 1/2 cup cornflour/cornstarch in a bowl. Dip prawn in; shake off excess then put on a plate. Repeat with all prawns. Chill dry ingredients: Whisk together flour; cornflour/cornstarch; baking powder and salt in a bowl. Place in fridge while oil heats up. (Helps keep batter cold; cold batter = crispier prawns) Heat oil: Fill small pot or large saucepan with 4cm / 1.7" oil. Heat to 160°C/320°F on medium high stove. Make cold batter: When the oil is near target temp; add soda water into the dry ingredients. Then do the minimum whisks to just combine (10 or so) – a few lumps ok; better than whisking too much (changes coating texture). Batter thickness: Should fully coat prawns easily; not be see-through; but not thick and heavy. See video at 38 seconds for cues. Use extra soda water 1 teaspoon at a time to achieve right thickness. Dredge: Holding a prawn by the tail; dip into the batter then hold up for a 2 seconds to let the excess batter drip off. Then carefully place in oil. Repeat with another 5 prawns (6 per batch). 3 minutes Fry #1: Cook for 3 minutes until light golden and crispy. When you pick them up; you can tell it's very crispy. Drain and repeat: Place prawns on a tray with paper towels. Repeat with remaining prawns. I cook in 4 batches. Don't crowd the pot as it brings oil temperature down too much. Cool prawns for 20 minutes (Note 5). Meanwhile; make Sauce. Simmer: Place ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to simmer; turn down stove to medium low then leave to simmer for 3 minutes. Syrupy consistency: The consistency should be like maple syrup (see video). Turn off stove; place lid on to keep warm (when cool; it gets too thick to toss prawns in it). Heat oil to 200°C/390°F. 3 minutes Fry #2: Place half the prawns in oil (you can crowd the pot for Fry #2). Cook for 3 minutes or until it changes from pale golden to very golden; then remove to a paper towel-lined plate. You can tell by touching that it's built-to-last crispy! More golden = crispier (but don't overcook the prawns!) Repeat with remaining prawns.  Quickly toss: Transfer prawns to a metal bowl then pour over Honey Sauce. Quickly toss with rubber spatula to coat prawns in sauce. (Sauce starts thickening if you take too long; so be quick!) Garnish: Pile prawns over crispy rice noodles (if using); scatter with sesame seeds; green onion and serve! At any point while oil is hot; drop a wad of noodles into hot oil; wait 3 seconds until it puffs up; then remove with tongs. Drain on paper towels; place on plate. Top with prawns! (Note: Crispy noodles stays crispy "forever" so you can do this well ahead. Not for eating – is flavourless.)
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-fricassee-quick-french-chicken-stew/, Season chicken: Pat chicken dry with paper towels then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brown thighs: Melt butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet or heavy based pot with a lid. Add chicken thighs; skin side down; and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden brown. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute then remove to a plate. Brown drumsticks: Then brown the drumsticks; as best you can. I do 3 sides; about 2 minutes each. Then remove from skillet. Sauté mushrooms and onion: Add mushrooms; onion; bay leave and thyme. Cook for 5 minutes until mushroom is lightly golden – they won't go deep golden brown. Garlic and flour: Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Wine and chicken stock: Add wine; chicken stock; salt and pepper. Stir; scraping the base of the pot to dissolve the brown residue stuck to the pan ("fond") into the sauce. Return chicken to sauce: Return chicken back into the sauce with the skin side up. Simmer covered 10 minutes: Once it comes to a simmer; adjust heat so it's bubbling constantly but not rapidly (see video) – medium-low on my stove. Cover with lid and simmer 10 minutes. Uncover 20 minutes: Remove lid and let it simmer for a further 20 minutes. Chicken will be cooked – internal temperature 75°C/167°F or slightly higher. Creamy sauce: Remove chicken to a plate. Add cream and stir. Once it comes up to a simmer; taste sauce (I know; big ask!); and add more salt if desired.. Serve! Return chicken into the sauce then remove from the stove. Sprinkle with parsley and serve! Traditionally served over mashed potato or rice. Also ideal with short pasta like penne; ziti or macaroni.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-stock-recipe/, Fill pot: Place all the chicken stock ingredients into a large stockpot (7 litre / 7 quarts+). Fill with 3 litres / 3 quarts of cold water; which should just about cover the bones. (Note 3) Scoop off scum: Bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Scoop off and discard any foam that collects on the surface using a ladle (this helps make stock clear). Simmer 3 hours: Turn stove down to low and simmer for 3 hours with no lid. The stove should be low enough so the surface is barely rippling and you just get a gentle bubble every now and then. Too rapid boiling = murky stock. Strain: Using a lid to hold the bones and vegetables in the pot; pour the stock through a fine sieve into another pot or large bowl. (Alternatively; scoop out the solids first with a slotted spoon and then strain.) Goal: You should end up with 2 litres / 2 quarts of stock. If you have more than about 2.25 litres / quarts; reduce by simmering on low (else the stock will be too weak). If you have less than 2 litres / quarts; top up with water. Fill jars/containers: Measure out into containers for storage and faster cooling. (I do multiples of 1 cup) Cool: Allow to cool on the counter then refrigerate. This will make any fat rise to surface and solidify. Discard fat: Scrape fat off the surface and discard. Ready to use! This stock is equivalent in strength to store-bought stock; so it can be used 1:1 in any recipe calling for chicken stock. Store for 5 days in the fridge or freezer for 6 months. (Note 6) Salt adjustment (Note 5): Homemade stock is unsalted whereas store-bought stock is salted. Add 1/4 tsp salt for every 1 cup homemade chicken stock (250ml) to match the salt level of store-bought low sodium chicken stock. To use: Cold stock has a jellied consistency (Note 4). It takes barely a minute to turn liquid on a medium-high stove; or microwave. You can also just add it in jelly form straight into dishes; but sometimes you may need to liquify it to measure.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-cake-with-lemon-frosting/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) for 20 minutes before starting the batter (Note 9). Place shelf in the middle of the oven. Cake pans: Grease 3 x 20cm / 8” cake pans with butter; then line with parchment / baking paper. (Note 10 more pan sizes) Best to use cake pan without loose base; if you can. Whisk flour; baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a Stand Mixer fitted with a whisk attachment; or hand beater. With the beater still going; pour the sugar in over 45 seconds. Then beat for 7 minutes on speed 8; or until tripled in volume and white. Heat Milk-Butter: While egg is beating; place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter (or use stove). Do not let milk bubble and boil (foam is ok). If you do this ahead; cover and keep hot while beating eggs. Gently add flour: When the egg is whipped; scatter 1/3 flour across surface; then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Add half remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 – 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can’t see flour; stop straight away. Lighten hot milk with some Egg Batter: Pour hot milk; vanilla; lemon juice and zest and oil into the now empty flour bowl. Add about 1 1/2 cups (2 ladles or so) of the Egg Batter into the Milk-Butter (don't need to be 100% accurate with amount). Use a whisk to mix until smooth – you can be vigorous here. Will look foamy. Slowly add milk: Turn beater back on Speed 1 then pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds; then turn beater off. Scrape and final mix: Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds – batter should now be smooth and pourable. Pour batter into pans.  Knock out bubbles: Bang each cake pan on the counter 3 times to knock out big bubbles (Note 10 for why) Bake 23 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean.  Remove from oven. Cool in cake pans for 15 minutes; then gently turn out onto cooling racks. If using as layer cakes; cool upside down – slight dome will flatten perfectly. Level cake = neat layers. Frost with provided Lemon Frosting; or Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting from this Lemon Blueberry Layer Cake recipe. Thickening roux: Place flour and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook; stirring constantly; for 30 seconds.  Add milk: While whisking constantly; slowly pour the milk in (this ensure it's lump free). As the milk gets hotter; it will start to thicken – stir constantly so the base doesn't catch. Thicken roux: Cook until the mixture thickens in a thick; dolloping custard – see video for texture. (Note 13 tip) Cool: Remove from heat and scrape into a bowl. Cover with cling wrap; pressing down onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Cool completely (20 min counter then 30 min fridge); but do not let it get fridge cold. (Note 14) It will firm into a very thick paste. FROSTING – cream butter: Beat butter with either a handheld beater or stand mixer (with whisk attachment) for 3 minutes until it's smooth and changes from yellow to very pale yellow; almost white. FROSTING – add roux: While beating on speed 5; add the roux one heaped tablespoon at a time. Take about 1 minute to add it all. Once all added; add lemon zest and juice; then whip for 2 minutes until you can see that it is stiff enough to hold peaks liek whipped cream. Do not whip more than 4 to 5 minutes (this will activate starch and make it sticky). Flip a cake layer upside down (for level surface). Spread with 3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16" frosting. Top with another upside cake layer; spread with ore frosting. Cover with final cake layer then use remaining frosting to cover top and sides.
https://www.recipetineats.com/bacon-wrapped-pork-tenderloin/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Lay out bacon: Lay the bacon strips vertically on a board; slightly overlapping (see photo in post). There should be enough bacon so when rolled will wrap the length of the pork. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Tuck the thin end of the fillet under so the pork is roughly the same thickness from end to end. Brown pork: Heat the oil in an oven-proof skillet over high heat. Sear the pork on all sides until nicely browned. (Don't worry about cooking through; it will go in the oven.) Turn off heat; remove pork and allow to cool enough to handle. Wrap pork in bacon: Place pork on the arranged bacon at the end closest to you. Use a long knife to lift the bacon under the pork and roll the pork so the bacon wraps around the fillet. Finish with the bacon seam side down. Honey: Use the knife to transfer back into the skillet. Drizzle over honey and brush all over. Bake 25 minutes: Transfer skillet to oven for 25 minutes and roast pork until the internal temperature is 65°C / 149°F. (Note 1) Baste with pan juices at the 20 minute mark; mopping up plenty of the honey and juices pooled in the pan (this will make bacon deep golden). Rest 5 minutes: Remove from oven and let it rest for 5 minutes. Baste once more just before serving. To serve; cut into thick slices. Serve with remaining pan juices.
https://www.recipetineats.com/italian-crusted-sardines/, Mix Crust: Mix the Italian Crust ingredients in a bowl. Spread on a small plate. Mix Topping: Mix the Topping together in another small bowl. Prepare sardines: Pat sardines dry with paper towel. Sprinkle both sides of each sardine with the salt and pepper. Sprinkle the skin side only with the paprika. Crust flesh side: Press flesh side only firmly into the breadcrumbs – it won't completely cover; that's what we want (Note 6). Place on plate; breadcrumb side up. Repeat with remaining sardines. Pan fry sardines: Heat oil in a large non stick skillet over medium high heat. Place sardines in; skin side down. Cook for 60 seconds; then carefully turn. Cook the crust side for 90 seconds or until golden and crispy. Topping & oil drizzle: Remove sardines onto plate; crust side up. Sprinkle with Topping. Pour remaining hot oil over sardines – enjoy the sizzle! Serve immediately! Ideal served with crostini for the ultimate sardines on toast. See in post for side salad pairings.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crostini/, Small crostini (for canapes) – slice bread 0.5cm / 1/4-inch thick on the diagonal. Large crostini (for serving on the side of dishes) – Cut on a diagonal; 1cm / 1/3"  thick. Preheat oven (all types):– Small crostini to 160°C/325°F– Large crostini to 180°C/350°F Brush olive oil lightly on bread; sprinkle with a bit of salt. Flip and repeat. Bake 10 minutes; turning halfway; or until fully crispy. Rub bread lightly on one side with cut face of garlic. Use warm if serving with a dish; or cool if piling on toppings.
https://www.recipetineats.com/family-meat-pie/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Brown beef: Sprinkle beef with 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Brown beef aggressively in 2 to 3 batches (do not crowd pot; else it gets watery instead of browning). Then remove beef into a big bowl. Wipe down pot: Wipe pot clean of burnt bits; if needed. Cook bacon: Cool pot; add bacon. Place pot back onto medium heat. When you see some fat starting to melt; turn heat up to medium high and cook bacon until golden. Then remove into bowl with beef. Cook mushrooms: Melt 30g/ 2tbsp butter in the pot. Cook mushrooms until golden with a pinch of salt and pepper. Remove into separate bowl with slotted spoon. Cook other vegetables: Add onion; garlic; carrot and celery then cook for 5 minutes until onion is soft and sweet; not too golden.  Add oil if needed; but bacon fat + residual butter should be enough. Oven slow cook: Add beef; bacon; Guinness; water; stock; 1/4 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp pepper. Stir then bring to simmer. Cover with lid; then transfer to oven for 1 hour. Add mushrooms; then continue cooking in the oven for a further 1 hour. Meat should be starting to be tender at this stage. Stove reduce: Remove pot from oven. Remove lid; then simmer on low heat for 20 minutes to reduce sauce. Meat should now be "fall-apart-tender" but just holding form (not disintegrating). Sauce thickener (Beurre Manié – Note 4): Mix together butter and flour until smooth. Thicken sauce: Stir Beurre Manié into sauce. Once melted; leave on the stove for another 2 minutes. Sauce should be thicker than a normal stew; like a honey consistency. Sauce will not thicken any more in oven; so make it exactly what you want – Note 7. Also; there will be more sauce than you expect for a pie – some gets absorbed by pastry (but won't make it soggy). Cool: Cover pot with lid; then let it cool completely; preferably overnight. (Note 8) Shortcrust base: Make and blind bake Shortcrust Pastry per that recipe using a 23cm/9” pie dish; whether using homemade or store bought. Then let it cool for at least 15 minutes (stays crispier). Preheat oven: Turn oven up to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Fill pie: Bring filling to room temp; do not use fridge cold. (Note 9) Fill pie with filling (use it all; pack it in a level surface or have slight mound). Puff pastry lid: Partially thaw puff pastry (do not cut). Brush lip of pie crust base with egg; then top with puff pastry sheet. Trim excess with scissors; press to adhere to edges. Then press the tip of a fork around the edge to make little crimps (to further adhere + decorative). Egg wash: Brush top with remaining whisked egg; then make a 2.5cm / 1" X incision in middle to allow steam to escape (stops lid doming). Bake: Bake 45 – 50 minutes until top is super golden. Rest 5 minutes. Brag in comments below that you made this magnificent pie. Save Nagi a slice. Then serve remainder with ketchup or Aussie tomato sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/sesame-crusted-tofu-steaks/, Season tofu: Pat tofu dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Prepare crust coating: Place flour; egg and sesame in separate bowls (medium shallow bowls or tupperware best). Sesame crust: Press tofu into flour; shake off excess. Dip in egg; then let excess drip off before coat in sesame seeds; pressing to adhere all over. Repeat with remaining tofu. Crispy garlic: Heat oil in a non stick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until golden and crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels. Cook tofu: Turn heat up to medium-high. Place tofu in skillet and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until the sesame smells nutty and becomes crisp. Turn carefully and cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes. Then use tongs to prop the tofu steaks up on its sides to sear the edges until crisp – about 30 seconds each side should do it (see video for my technique). Drain: Remove tofu to paper towel lined plate. Teriyaki Sauce: Lower heat to medium then add Teriyaki Sauce ingredients. Simmer for 1 minute until it reduces to a syrupy consistency; then remove skillet from stove. Serve: Place tofu steak on plate. Spoon over Teriyaki Sauce (it clings to sesame; don't worry; crust stays crispy). Sprinkle with garlic and green onion. Devour; then declare; "I LOVE TOFU!!".
https://www.recipetineats.com/el-bullis-bean-soup-with-picada/, Saute onion and herbs 8 minutes: Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic; onion; herbs and cook; stirring regularly; for 8 minutes until the onions are a deep golden brown and sweet. Cook tomato passata 8 minutes: Add tomato passata and cook over low heat for another 8 minutes until the tomato changes from red and watery to dark brown a d very thick. Don't skimp on this step; it's key for flavour! Simmer: Stir in the beans followed by the vegetable stock. Adjust heat so it's bubbling very gently and simmer for 15 minutes with the lid off. Blitz: Transfer 2/3 cup (150ml) of soup into a jug or jar large enough to fit the head of a blender stick. Blitz until smooth then stir it back into the soup to thicken the broth. Stir in Picada: Just before serving; stir in 2 tablespoons of Picada. Taste and add more salt if needed (canned beans differ in salt). Then serve immediately. Serve: Dollop each bowl with 1 teaspoon of remaining Picada. Crusty bread highly recommended (easy Artisan; no yeast bread or French brioche). Toast hazelnuts: Preheat a small skillet over medium heat. Add hazelnuts and toast; shaking the skillet regularly; until there are golden patches and they smell nutty. Remove most skin: Transfer hazelnuts to a clean tea towel. Bundle up and rub vigorously with hands to remove most of the skin (which is bitter). (No need to do this with almonds) Blitz: Roughly chop hazelnuts then add into a jug just large enough to fit the head of a stick blender with remaining ingredients. Blitz until it's like pesto – not completely smooth. Use per recipe.
https://www.recipetineats.com/coq-au-vin/, Marinate chicken: Place the Chicken Marinade ingredients in a large glass or ceramic bowl or dish. Marinate overnight in the fridge (minimum 12 hours; maximum 24 hours). Strain wine into a bowl. Reserve herbs and wine. Separate the chicken and onion. Dry chicken: Spread chicken out on a try lined with paper towels; then pat dry with paper towels. Reduce wine: Pour red wine into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Simmer vigorously; skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface; until reduced by half. Set aside. Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan). Season chicken: Sprinkle chicken with 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Brown chicken: Heat 3 tbsp oil in a large; heavy-based; oven-proof pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs skin side down and cook for 2 – 3 minutes until nicely browned (it will be darker than usual because of the red wine). Flip thighs and cook the other side for another minute to kiss it with a little colour. Remove to a tray. Pull at skin of drumsticks to cover flesh as best as possible; then brown (I do 3 to 4 sides; ~5 minutes in total). Remove and set aside. Fry bacon: Remove any loose black burnt bits. Add a bit of extra oil if needed; then cook bacon for 3 minutes until golden. Add to tray with chicken. Sauté mushrooms: Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes; or until golden. Remove into a separate bowl. Sauté onion: Add a bit of extra oil if needed; then cook onions for 5 minutes or until there are nice golden patches.  Butter and flour: Add butter into pot. Once melted; add garlic and cook for a further 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add wine and stock: While stirring; slowly pour in beef stock – this helps the flour dissolve lump-free into the stock. Then add the reduced wine and mix until flour mixture is dissolved and mostly lump-free. (Note 8) Add everything back in: Add chicken; bacon; mushroom; thyme; bay leaf; salt and pepper into the pot; then stir. Oven 45 minutes: Bring to a simmer; then cover and transfer to oven for 45 minutes. Chicken will be very tender – but not "falling apart". (Note 9) Adjust salt: Remove from oven; taste sauce and add salt if needed.  Leave overnight (recommended; Note 11): If time permits; leave the stew overnight before serving because as with all stews; it gets better with time! Reheat gently on a low stove in a covered pot; ensuring that chicken is fully heated through. Add water if needed to loosen sauce. Serve over mashed potato or tagliatelle; sprinkled with fresh parsley! For the ultimate experience; mop the plate clean with homemade brioche (surprisingly straight forward to make). See in post for side salad and dessert options.

Strain the rice and add it to a small pot or large saucepan. Pandan leaves: Add the knotted pandan leaves. Simmer 30 minutes: Add 4 cups of cold water. Bring to boil. Turn stove down to low so it's simmering very gently (small; slow little bubbles). Simmer 30 minutes (no lid); stirring frequently for the last 15 minutes and almost constantly towards the end (so the base does not catch). Consistency: Rice should be soft / fully cooked through; water reduced; and sauce should be creamy not watery (starch from rice thickens water). Add sugar: Stir in sugar and salt until it dissolves (~20 seconds). Ladle into bowls – it should ooze slowly; not be runny nor so thick it stays in a mound; see video for consistency. (If it's too thick; add a touch of water and stir). Toppings: Mix coconut cream with salt. Drizzle onto rice pudding. Top with toasted coconut and mango if using. Serve immediately.

https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-yellow-curry/, Soak dried chillis: Roughly chop chillies and transfer to bowl; leaving behind seeds. Cover with boiling water and soak for 30 minutes then drain (reserve soaking water). Check spiciness: Have a nibble of soaked chilli; should not be that spicy. If it is spicy; only use 1/3 to 1/2 of the amount (Note 1). Prepare lemongrass: Remove woody top half and outer layers of lemongrass. Grate with microplane. (See in post or video for preparation demo) Make curry paste: Place chillis; lemongrass and all remaining curry paste ingredients in a jar just wide enough to fit a stick blender. Add 3 tablespoons chilli soaking water. Blitz with stick blender until smooth so there's no hard grit – rub between your fingers to check – about 15 seconds on high. (Or use small food processor or Nutribullet; scraping down sides well). Cook off curry paste: Heat oil in a medium heavy based skillet over medium heat.

Bake: Bake in oven for 12 – 15 minutes until egg whites are just set and yolks are cooked to your liking (I like runny!). Check it at 12 minutes – hotter ovens; lower walled ramekins etc can make them cook faster. Take out of oven slightly undercooked as egg will keep cooking.  Paprika: Sprinkle smoked paprika and chives on top; serve immediately with warm bread for dunking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/smoked-sausage-and-rice-quick-one-pot-meal/, Cook sausage: Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large heavy based pot over medium high heat. Add sausages and cook until golden.

Add 1/4 cup of pasta cooking water reserved from previous step (Note 5) then use 2 wooden spoons to toss the pasta; still on a low stove; for 1 minute or until the sauce is no longer in the skillet but rather clinging to the pasta strands (but still slick and slippery). If the pasta gets too dry; add more pasta cooking water and toss. Serve: Immediately transfer into warmed bowls. Drizzle with olive oil; sprinkle with basil. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/red-velvet-cupcakes/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Line a standard 12 hole muffin tin with cupcake liners. Sift Dry ingredients together into a bowl. Cream butter: Put the butter in a separate bowl and beat on speed 2 for 1 minute with an electric mixer or stand mixer (paddle attachment). Cream sugar: Add sugar then beat for a further 2 minutes; same speed; until the butter is very pale yellow; almost white. Beat in eggs: Add the eggs one at a time beating for 30 seconds on speed 1 after each addition. Add remaining Wet ingredients: Add oil; buttermilk; vanilla and red food colouring then beat on Speed 1 until incorporated and the batter is smooth. Beat in flour: Sprinkle the Dry ingredients across the surface and mix on Speed 1 for just 20 seconds. Scrape down sides of the bowl; then mix again for 10 seconds. The batter should now be smooth – few small lumps is ok. Do not keep beating – overworks batter = cupcakes not as soft! Fill pan: Divide the batter between the 12 cupcake liners – it should fill 3/4 of the way; but it depends on the size of the cupcake liners you use. Bake for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the middle cupcake comes out clean. Cool: Immediately remove cupcakes onto a wire rack. Cool completely before frosting with cream cheese frosting. Cream butter: Place butter in a bowl and beat for 1 minute until it's smooth and starts to become paler in colour – speed 6 on stand mixer; speed 9 for electric beater. Cream cream cheese: Add cream cheese then beat for a further 1 minute on the same speed until smooth. Add icing sugar: Add icing sugar in 4 batches; beating in between until incorporated; starting on speed 1 so you don't get a dust storm in your face! Beat until fluffy: Add vanilla and salt; then beat for 2 minutes until fluffy – speed 6 with stand mixer; speed 9 with electric beater. It should be creamy but still hold its shape in a peak (see video). If it's too sloppy; place in fridge for 30 minutes; then beat again. Pipe: Transfer into piping bag with desired piping tip. Pipe onto cupcakes – makes enough to generously frost 12 cupcakes as pictured in post.

https://www.recipetineats.com/panzanella-italian-tomato-bread-salad/, Preheat oven to 180°C /350°F (160°C fan). Toss bread chunks with 1 tbsp olive oil in a bowl. Toast: Spread bread on a a tray and toast for about 15 minutes; until the outside is becoming golden and crunchy but the inside is still a little soft; like toast. Remove and leave to cool. Cut tomato into 8 wedges each. Cut some of these wedges into half (I like irregular shapes for this rustic salad). Sweat tomato with salt: Put tomatoes into a colander over a large bowl. Season with the salt; toss and set aside for 10 minutes to draw out the juices. RESERVE the tomato juice in the bowl for the dressing. Cut cucumber into any shaped chunks aroun 2.5cm / 1" pieces. Again; I like to do irregular but even-sized shapes. Toss veg: Place tomato sweating in colander into large bowl. Add cucumber and basil; toss gently. Tomato Dressing: Add Dressing ingredients into bowl holding the tomato juice; whisk well. Dress salad: Add bread to salad; pour over dressing. Give it a light toss.

Blood Orange Drizzle Dressing: Measure out 2 tsp pickling vinegar; shake/whisk with the reserved 2 tsp juice; 2 tbsp EVOO with a pinch of salt and pepper. Lightly dress fennel: Toss fennel in 1 tbsp onion pickling juice; remaining 2 tbsp olive oil; 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper.  Assembling: Place 1/2 orange rounds on plate. Pile over 2/3 the fennel; litter with onion; parsley; place half remaining orange slices on top. Top with remaining fennel; oranges then onion. Sprinkle with parsley leaves. Just before serving; drizzle over the Blood Orange Dressing; mainly on the oranges so it doesn’t stain the fennel too much. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cafe-de-paris-butter-sauce-for-steak/, Place ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. Place on cling wrap and roughly shape into a 20cm / 8″ log using spatulas or butter knives. Roll up; then twist ends tightly. As you tighten the ends; the butter will shape into a neat; firm log. Tie ends if needed to keep the shape. Refrigerate for 3 hours or until firm. To use – Slice into 0.7cm (1/3") slices; then let them soften to room temperature (so they melt easier). Place on hot steak so it melts – I use 2 slices each steak. Leftovers – fridge 3 days or freeze 2 months (pre sliced for ease of use). Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking. Dry: Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot – you should see smoke! Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper; then immediately place in the skillet. Cook steak to taste: For 2cm (3/4") thick steaks; cook the first side for 2 minutes; then turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes (medium rare 52°C/125°F; chart below for other doneness temps). Rest: Transfer steaks to a warm plate; cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 to 10 minutes; then serve. Leftovers – fridge 3 days or freeze 2 months (pre sliced for ease of use).
https://www.recipetineats.com/ayam-goreng-malaysian-fried-chicken/, Toast spices: Toast spices in a small skillet over medium heat (no oil) for 2 minutes or until the spices smell fragrant. Transfer seeds into Nutribullet; small food processor OR into a tall jug that fits a stick blender. Curry paste: Add remaining Curry Paste ingredients and blend until smooth. Marinate: Pour Curry Paste over chicken in a ziplock bag (or bowl; Note 6). Toss to coat; then marinate for 24 hours in the fridge; up to 48 hours.  Dechill chicken: Remove chicken from fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking and transfer into a bowl (most marinade should be stuck to chicken). Preheat oven to 80°C/175°F and place rack on tray – to keep chicken warm. (Note 7) Cornflour coating: Add cornflour to chicken and toss to coat – it will thicken the paste; this is what makes the craggy coating. Heat oil 180°C/350°F: Pour oil into a wide; heavy based pot to a depth of 6 cm / 2.5 " (my 26cm/10.5" cast iron pot = 1.75L/quarts oil; Note 8). Heat over medium high heat to 180°C/350°F – maintain temp as best you can (Note 9). This recipe will NOT work well with an air fryer – see Note 8. Fry: Carefully place 3 pieces of chicken in; do not touch for 2 min (to let crust adhere). Oil temperature should drop to 150°C/300°C – increase heat if needed. Fry 8 minutes (75°C / 167°F): Fry for 8 minutes (wings for 5 minutes); or until deep golden brown and internal temperature at thickest part is 75°C / 167°F. Keep warm: Place cooked chicken onto rack and keep warm in oven. Cook remaining chicken. Serve immediately; sprinkled with coriander and garlic-chilli garnish; if using. See in post for side dish suggestions! Heat 3 tbsp oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and chilli; cook until garlic is starting to go light golden. Then add green onion and cook until garlic is golden. Drain on paper towels; sprinkle with salt. Cool then sprinkle on chicken.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-cakes/, Bake potatoes in a 220°C / 430°F (200°C fan) oven for 75 minutes or until they can be pierced with a knife with no resistance. Cut in half and scoop flesh out into a large bowl. Turn oven down to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan) – fish cakes are finished in the oven. Set a rack over a tray. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add half the fish and cook; turning; for 4 minutes in total. It should be just cooked inside (ie. flakes easily) but not golden. Transfer to rack to cool. Repeat with remaining fish. Sauté garlic: In the same skillet; add garlic; chilli ;thyme and green onion into the leftover butter. Cook for 1 minute until garlic is golden; then pour over the potato; being sure to scrape out every drop of butter! Roughly mash potato: Add parsley and salt; then use a wooden spoon to roughly mash the potato. Don't use a potato masher; we want some chunks; not smooth mashed potato. Mix in fish: Add fish then gently stir through; breaking it up a bit so you have some nice flakes mixed throughout the potato. Don't mash the fish up too enthusiastically – we want fish chunks! Form fish cakes: Scoop out 1/4 cup of mixture. Pack it in firmly; pop out onto hand and shape firmly into a 1.75cm / 2/3" thick cake. The potato will make it hold together; if you press firmly. You should make 13 to 15. Crumb: Coat in flour (shake off excess); dip in egg (let excess drip off) then coat in breadcrumbs; pressing to adhere. Pan fry 3 minutes: Heat oil in skillet over medium high heat. Cook fish cakes in batches for 1 1/2 minutes on each side until golden; then transfer to a paper towel-lined tray. If you're pedantic like me; stand them on their side and roll slowly to cook and make the sides golden too. Bake 10 minutes: Remove paper towel from under the fish cakes. Bake for 10 minutes (this heats all the fish cakes all the way through into the middle + reheats the first batch cooked). Serve with lemon wedges; tartare sauce; plain mayonnaise (Kewpie!); sour cream; ketchup or tomato sauce.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-fried-rice/, Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Mix ingredients in baking dish: Place all Baked Fried Rice ingredients except bacon in a baking dish (~22 x 32cm / 9 x 13"). Stir; then spread rice evenly across pan. Top with bacon: Scatter bacon across surface. Bake covered 40 min: Cover with foil. Bake 40 minutes. Bake uncovered 15 min: Remove foil. Bake uncovered 15 minutes – this will colour the bacon. Liquid should be absorbed; rice should be cooked (but will seem wet; will absorb and soften while resting). Rest 10 min: Cover loosely with foil; stand for 10 minutes. Fluff: Add green onion and sesame oil. Fluff rice with fork; marvel at how perfectly cooked the rice grains are. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/peach-cobbler/, Macerate peaches: Put peaches and sugar in a large bowl and toss together. Leave for 40 minutes to macerate; to let the peaches leach juice and sweat. Preheat oven: Partway through the maceration; preheat oven to 210°C/410°F (200°C fan). Drain peaches: Drain in a colander; saving the juices. Syrup: Measure out 1/4 cup (65ml) juice and put in a large bowl. Add cornflour; salt and 1 tbsp of the lemon juice to the peach juice. Mix well. Mix with peaches: Pour peaches into the syrup; toss to coat. Taste – it should be a bit tart; slightly sweet; but not overly sweet. Add more lemon or sugar to adjust to your taste (fresh peaches always vary in sweetness!). Parbake peaches: Pour the peaches and juice into a medium glass or ceramic baking pan. Mine is a 28 x 18cm / 11 x 7" oval dish (Note 2). Bake 12 minutes; then remove. Rub in butter: Meanwhile; whisk together flour; sugar; baking powder; baking soda; and salt to combine. Add butter and rub it in with your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs (Alternatively; food processor via 10 x 1-sec pulses). Gently fold through yogurt: Add yogurt and gently mix through with rubber spatula until a dough is formed. Stop mixing when yogurt is mostly mixed through with some streaks of flour still visible (they will disappear when topping). Top peaches: Crumble lumps of the topping across the surface. Don't fully cover the surface; to let some heat through else the syrup won't reduce and thicken. Sprinkle with demerara sugar and cinnamon. Bake for 20 minutes; then remove from oven. The cobbler is done when an instant read thermometer measures the centre of the biscuit topping as 95°C/203°F and the top is a lovely golden. Rest to thicken sauce: Rest for 20 minutes to allow syrup to thicken – it will still be perfectly warm for serving. Serve with a dollop of ice cream or whipped cream!
https://www.recipetineats.com/sticky-honey-soy-baked-chicken/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Line pan: Line a baking dish with foil then baking paper. The baking tray should fit the chicken comfortably; not too spaced apart (glaze will dry out); not too snug (glaze won't thicken enough). (Note 3) Glaze: Mix the Glaze ingredients together. Pour glaze over chicken: Place onion and chicken in the baking dish skin side down; then pour the Glaze over. Bake 50 – 60 minutes: Bake for 25 minutes; then turn and bake for a further 25 to 35 minutes; until the chicken is browned and the glaze is sticky. If the glaze is not syrupy; remove the chicken to a plate and put the pan back in for a few minutes (it will reduce quickly). Squidge/coat chicken – Turn chicken and squidge in the glaze; then also spoon it over.  Serve! Serve with rice and steamed greens; sprinkled with sesame seeds and fresh cilantro/coriander leaves.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-vegetables/, Potatoes – Cut in half. (For large; cut into 3 or 4) Carrots – Cut into 3cm / 1.2" triangles on the diagonal (see diagram in post). Parsnip – Cut into 4cm / 1.5" lengths. Then cut into batons / chunks so they are roughly equal size (see diagram in post). Red onion – Cut in half; then cut each half into 4 wedges. Then in cut into 3 or 4 so you get 2cm/ 0.8" squares. Smashed garlic – Place side of knife on unpeeled garlic clove. Hit firmly with palm of hand so the garlic bursts open a bit but mostly stays in tact.  Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Onion – Toss onion in one bowl with 1 tablespoon oil; and a pinch of the salt and pepper. Set aside – we add these later. Other vegetables – Put all other vegetables; thyme and garlic in a separate bowl. Tear sage leaves and stems with hands; add into bowl. Toss with remaining oil; salt and pepper. Spread on a large baking tray. Roasting – Roast 30 minutes. Add onion; toss vegetables. Roast for a further 1 hour; tossing halfway; until cooked through with golden edges. Garnish & serve – Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/borek-turkish-spiced-lamb-filo-pastry/, Cook onion and garlic: Heat oil on high in a large skillet. Cook onion and garlic for 2 to 3 minutes until softened.  Cook lamb and spices: Add lamb and cook lamb; breaking it up as you go; until mostly changes from pink to brown. Then add all the spices and cook for 1 minute. Simmer: Add tomato passata and water; mix. Then add currants and pine nuts. Bring to simmer; turn heat down to medium low and cook until liquid reduces so the mixture is moist but not watery. Cool: Remove from stove and allow to fully cool before using. Mix ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside for at least 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Yogurt Wash (Note 4): Mix ingredients until combined. Prepare filo: Open the filo pastry packet and unroll the pastry. Peel one layer off and place on a piece of baking / parchment paper. Cover the remainder with a lightweight damp tea towel to stop them from drying out. Brush with yogurt wash: Drizzle / flick yogurt wash across filo using a pastry brush. Then lightly brush across surface in a thin layer. You don't need to cover every inch; just mostly cover the surface. Layer filo: Top with another filo pastry sheet; and brush this too with yogurt wash. Then repeat so you have 4 layers in total; but do not brush the last (4th) filo with yogurt wash once laid. Fill and roll: Place 1/3 of the Lamb filling along the bottom edge. Using the aid of a long kitchen knife to get it started; roll up into a log. Doesn't need to be tight and don't try; as the pastry is delicate. Make 3 logs: Repeat to make 3 logs; using all the Filling.  Spiral: Take one log and place on a piece of baking / parchment paper. Coil into a spiral. Join a second log to the first by stuffing the ends inside each other; using yogurt wash to adhere. Continue forming the spiral. Log sides should be in contact but not tightly squished. Transfer to baking vessel: Brush a 26cm / 10.5″ cast iron skillet (Note 5) with melted butter. Then use the paper to transfer the borek into the skillet; and slide the paper out. Brush with butter: Brush the top with butter; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 40 minutes or until pastry is golden. Serve! Remove from oven. Cut wedges like pie. Serve with Lemon Yogurt Sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-satay-with-thai-peanut-sauce/, If cooking on a BBQ or over charcoal; soak skewers for 2 hours in water so they don't burn. Mix together the beef and Marinade in a bowl. Cover with cling wrap and marinate overnight (do not reduce marinating time else the beef may not tenderise enough). Thread onto skewers – I do 4 pieces each. Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook 10 minutes (yes; well done!): Cook skewers in batches for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes on all 4 sides until deep golden (total of 8 to 10 minutes) and fully cooked through. (Note: baking soda tenderised beef needs to be thoroughly cooked to be tender. The beef is still a bit chewy if it's medium or less.)  Rest: Transfer skewers to plate and rest for 3 minutes before serving with Peanut Sauce. Place all Peanut Sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Stir to combine then simmer; stirring every now and then; for 5 minutes. Adjust consistency with water – it should be a pourable but thickish sauce. Remove from stove; cover with lid and keep warm while cooking skewers. Pour sauce into a bowl. Sprinkle with some peanuts – stir some through if you want. Pile satay skewers onto a platter; sprinkle with remaining peanuts; coriander and chilli. Serve with sauce on the side for dipping. Add a side of Jasmine Rice or Thai Fried Rice  or Pineapple Fried Rice to complete the meal!
https://www.recipetineats.com/mushroom-stuffed-chicken-breast/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°F fan). Cut pockets into each chicken breast; being sure not to cut all the way through (see photos in post). Cut on the side with the fold in the meat; to keep the smooth side intact. Season the inside and outside of the chicken with half the salt and pepper. Mushroom filling: Melt butter in a heavy based oven proof skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes until they start to turn pretty golden. Then add garlic; thyme; remaining salt and pepper and continue cooking for a further 2 minutes until mushrooms are nice and golden. Add spinach: Add baby spinach and stir until wilted – about 30 seconds. Stuff mushroom mixture into the pocket of each chicken; then top with cheese. Seal with toothpicks as best you can – it doesn’t need to be fully sealed like we do with Chicken Kiev. Just mostly sealed. Sear chicken: Give the pan a quick wipe with paper towels. Heat oil over medium high heat. Sear each side of the chicken breast for 1 1/2 minutes until golden. Bake 15 minutes: Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 15 minutes; or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 65°C/149°F (chicken flesh; not the mushroom filling). Rest 5 minutes: Remove from tray onto a plate; loosely cover with foil and rest for 5 minutes. Serve!

https://www.recipetineats.com/singapore-chilli-crab/, Prepare crab: See separate tutorial for how to clean and cut a whole crab. You will end up with: 1) Crab pieces; and 2) Reserved tomalley ("crab mustard"; Note 8) and crab juices in a separate bowl. This is a key "secret ingredient" used to flavour the sauce. Chilli paste: Place ingredients in a small food processor or Nutribullet. Blitz until it's a fairly smooth paste. Sauté belachan: Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add belachan and cook for 2 minutes; stirring constantly. It will smell pungent (to put it mildly); but have faith! It will mellow and transform! Cook off chilli paste: Add chilli paste and cook; stirring; for 3 minutes. Add tomato passata: Add tomato passata and cook; stirring regularly; for 4 minutes. Add remaining sauce ingredients: Add sweet chilli sauce; ketchup; water and stir to combine. Add claws: Add the crab claws first (they take longer to cook); stir to coat in sauce. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat to simmer. Cover with a lid and cook 3 minutes. Add "crab mustard" and juices: Add the reserved tomalley ("crab mustard") along with all the crab juices.  Add remaining crab pieces: Remove lid; add remaining crab pieces and any juices that have collected in this bowl. Stir pieces to coat; put the lid back on and cook for 7 minutes. Remove crab: Use tongs to remove crab pieces into a bowl. Egg ribbons: With the sauce still on the stove; and while stirring in a circular motion; pour the egg in a thin stream into the middle of the pot. This will create little ribbons of egg in the sauce that is traditional and look lovely. Vinegar: Stir in vinegar. Return crab: Return the crab pieces into the pot; gently stir to coat in the sauce. Transfer crab pieces into a large serving plate or shallow dish. Pour over all the sauce from the pot. Garnish with coriander and green onion. Serve with golden mantou buns (steamed and fried Chinese buns; traditional – Note 7); or homemade brioche (ultimate sub!); baguette; crusty bread or dinner rolls. Alternatively serve with rice on the side. How to eat: Be prepared to get messy! Dive in for the claw (the prime piece!). Use crab or nut crackers to break the shell (or a meat tenderiser or hammer – anything to get to that meat!!) and reveal hunks of sweet juicy crab meat. Dunk generously in sauce and devour. Leftover Sauce: You will have leftover sauce. It's loaded with flavour so save it; it's precious! See in post for ideas for how to use.
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-clean-and-cut-a-whole-crab/, Freeze 1 hour: Place the crab in the freezer for 1 hour or until it stops moving; but don't let the crab freeze. It may take slightly longer for larger crabs. Ensure eyes and limbs aren't moving; no active bubbling around the mouth and legs hang limp. Once the crab is asleep; prepare it straight away. (Note 3) Details in post: See diagrams in post for crab body parts referred to in this section. Cut off leg tips: Cut off the sharp tips of each of the legs (not claw). Remove belly flap: Twist off the belly flap and discard. Remove top shell (carapace): Working from the back of the crab; put your thumb between the body and the top shell (carapace) and pull it off. If you have trouble here; run a small knife down each side of the shell first. Reserve tomalley: Scrape out and save the tomalley (yellow and green "crab mustard"; Note 4) from top shell and body. Discard mandibles and gills: Remove mandibles and gills; discard. Remove claws: Seperate arms from body using a cleaver. Crack claw shell: Give it a whack with the back of a knife to create some cracks in the shell; but try not to break the shell completely (so the claw still holds together). This helps with even cooking makes it easier to eat. If claws are really large; cut claws from arms at the joint. Cut body up: Cut crab body in half down the middle. Then cut each piece into 2 (or 3 if large). Refrigerate: Place crab pieces in a large bowl and refrigerate until use. Use within 24 hours. Clean tomalley: Scrape all the crab juices from the cutting board into the bowl with the tomalley. Pick out the grey or white membranes and gently scrape off the tomalley (the yellow/green substance) as best you can back into the bowl. Discard all the grey membranes. Keep the crab juices and tomalley for use in cooking – this packs a ton of crab flavour! Use crab pieces as directed by your chosen recipe. Best crab recipe in the world? Singapore Chilli Crab!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cold-corn-soup-for-summer/, Cut off kernels: Cut the corn kernels off the cobs and transfer to a bowl. Corn stock: Cut the cobs in half. Place in a large pot with the water. Bring to a boil; then reduce to medium low and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain – it should be 2 litres. If it's much more ; simmer to reduce. If less; top up with water. Sachet: Bundle the bay leaf; thyme; black peppercorns and coriander seeds loosely in a small piece of cheesecloth to create a sachet. Tie with cooking twine to secure. Sauté aromatics: Melt butter in a pot over medium high heat. Add onion; celery; leek and garlic. Cook for 4 – 5 minutes until soft. Cook corn: Add corn kernels then cook for 6 to 7 minutes. Simmer: Add the corn stock and the sachet. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Cream: Add the cream and cook for 3 minutes. Blend and sieve: Remove the Sachet. Blend in batches in a blender on high speed until smooth. CAUTION! Hot liquid + tightly sealed blender lid = soup explosion! To avoid this; either cool before blending. OR remove the lid of the feeding tube in the blender lid. Cover the exposed hole with a folded tea towel as you blend hot liquid. You will see me do this in the recipe video. Strain: Pass through a fine sieve. Adjust salt: Taste and add more salt if needed. Chill and serve: Cool; then transfer to the fridge to chill completely. Intended to be served chilled or cool; but also great at room temperture or warm! How to serve: In shot glasses as a canape; tea cups as a small starter; or bowls as a meal with hunks of crusty bread. Garnish with kernels sauteed in butter with green onion slices and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (basil oil would be even more incredible!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-seasoning-spice-mix/, Fish Seasoning: Place ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. It will keep for months in an airtight container. This quantity is enough for 750g / 1.5lb fish (serves 4 people) Season fish: Sprinkle Seasoning on both sides of fish. Lightly rub to spread Seasoning.

https://www.recipetineats.com/oatmeal-raisin-cookie-soft-chewy/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Adjust oven racks to middle and low position; ensuring you have 4"/10cm between each rack. Line 2 trays with parchment/baking paper. Optional: Soak raisins in boiled water for 10 minutes. Drain then pat dry. (This makes them plumper). Sift dry ingredients: Sift flour; salt; baking powder and cinnamon into a bowl. Cream butter and sugar: Using a stand mixer or electric mixer; beat butter until creamy. Then beat in sugar until fluffy – about 2 – 3 minutes. Add eggs: Beat in eggs one at a time until incorporated. Mix in flour: Use a wooden spoon to stir the flour mixture in. Stir in oats and raisins: Stir in oats and raisins – this requires a bit of effort as the dough gets firm! Roll and flatten balls: Form 4cm / 1.6" balls (~18) and place onto baking trays 4"/10cm apart. I use an ice cream scoop. Then press down to slighty flatten into a thick disc shape. Bake for 11 minutes. Then swap the trays between the shelves AND turn the trays around. Bake for a further 11 – 14 minutes; or until cookies are golden on the edges and LIGHT golden on the surface. Cool on the trays for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Cool for 30 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/spiral-sweet-potato-bake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Brush skillet base and sides with a little olive oil. Slice potatoes: Slice potatoes 3-4mm thick.

Bake uncovered 20 minutes: Bake 20 minutes until tops are golden and slightly crisp; and potato is cooked through (check with a knife or skewer). Serve: Scatter with more rosemary leaves; a whole sprig of rosemary and pinch of sea salt flakes if desired. Serve immediately! Sweet potato loses crispiness as it cools.
https://www.recipetineats.com/malfatti-italian-spinach-ricotta-dumplings/, Saute garlic and onion: Heat oil in a small pot or large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and onion and cook for 3 minutes until onion is softened. Simmer sauce: Add remaining ingredients plus the stem of basil. Bring to a simmer; then reduce stove to low and cook; stirring every now and then; for 20 minutes. It should be fairly thick rather than a loose runny sauce. Drain ricotta; if needed: The ricotta should be the dry and fairly crumbly type rather than wet; soft and almost spreadable. If it's wet; see Note 1 for removing excess water (wet ricotta makes Malfatti hard to shape and cook!) Sweat spinach: Toss spinach with 1/2 tsp salt in large colander. Leave for 20 minutes. Roll up in tea towel and squeeze tightly to remove excess liquid. Roughly chop. Sauté garlic; eschalot and spinach: Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and eschalot; cook for 1 minute until translucent. Add spinach and cook until just wilted. Transfer to large bowl; allow to cool. Malfatti mixture: Add ricotta and all remaining Malfatti ingredients into the bowl. Mix well to combine. It should be too wet to roll with hands without sticking; but still firm enough to shape into dumplings. Form dumplings: Using 2 dessert spoons; scoop up about 1 1/2 tablespoons of mixture then shape into a football (quenelle) using the two spoons. Place on a paper-lined tray. You should get about 24-30. Boil dumplings: Bring a large pot of water to the boil; then carefully put 6 dumplings in. Cook for 2 minutes; they should float to the surface. Remove with slotted spoon on to paper towel lined tray. Repeat for remaining Malfatti. Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F. Assemble: Pour Napoli Sauce into a baking dish; then top with Malfatti. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Bake 15 minutes or until the Malfatti has a faint blush of gold on the surface (Note 3). Serve! Sprinkle baked Malfatti with parmesan and basil leaves (tear large leaves). Spoon into bowls and served as-is. No starchy side is required; think of these as like gnocchi. Just add a leafy green salad with Italian Dressing or Balsamic Dressing!
https://www.recipetineats.com/best-pound-cake/, Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (165°C fan) with the shelf arranged so the loaf pan will sit in the middle of the oven.

Increase to Speed 7 and continue to beat for 1 minute. Add half of remaining egg mix: Scrape down the bowl. Add half the remaining egg mixture (ie. 1/4 of the original total) and beat 20 seconds on Speed 7. Add remaining egg mix: Scrape down the sides again. Add all the remaining egg mixture (ie. 1/4 of the original total) and beat 20 seconds. Fill pan: Scrape batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. First bake (30 min): Bake for 30 minutes until top begins to split slightly. Cut split (optional): Working quickly; open the oven (do not take pan out) and make a light cut with a small; sharp knife along the split (15 cm / 6") to help the split to open up nicely. Work fast –  do not leave oven open for long or the cake will collapse. Second bake (20 min): Bake another 20-25 minutes until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. If the cake is getting dark you can cover it with a loose sheet of foil towards the end of the bake time. Cool: Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Serving: Serve thick slices with any of the following or a combination – whipped cream and fruit (traditional); just butter; butter + honey (pictured in post); a fruit compote; mascarpone or thick yogurt with crushed nuts (pistachio would be fabulous!).

Place on pea puree; then drizzle with Herb Brown Butter. Optional garnish with any combination of dill; parsley; chervil.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-tart/, Make tart crust per linked recipe; including blind baking the empty tart crust. Allow to fully cool before filling (to ensure it won't go soggy). Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 180℃/350℉ (160℃ fan) Whisk ingredients together: Put all ingredients in a medium saucepan and whisk to combine. Thicken on stove: Place the saucepan on the stove over low / medium low heat. Whisk constantly; especially as the butter is melting; to ensure it doesn't split. Keeping stirring until the mixture thickens enough to visibly mound (ie. holds its shape briefly) on the surface when dolloped – about 5 minutes; though it might take longer depending on stove strength; saucepan heat retention etc. See video and photos for thickness guide. Don't take it off the stove until it's thick enough otherwise the Filling won't set. Strain into a bowl using a fine mesh strainer. Fill tart: Pour into tart shell and smooth the filling surface using an offset spatula or similar. Bake: Bake for 5 minutes. It will still be a soft custard when you touch it but not liquidity. It will set more when cooled so it's sliceable.  Cool: Cool tart fully to allow it to set before slicing to serve. Pictured with a dollop of creme fraiche (a thick; rich cream that has a slight tartness; and goes very well with the lemon tart) or whipped cream and even vanilla ice cream. Decorate if desired with lemon slices; edible flowers; raspberries. Else pipe on dollops of whipped cream or dust with icing sugar!
https://www.recipetineats.com/duck-confit/, Coat duck with dry cure: Place duck legs and all the Dry Cure ingredients in a large bowl. Toss well with your hands. Cure 12 – 24 hrs: Transfer to a ceramic or glass dish large enough so the duck fits in a single layer but snugly. Cover and refrigerate for 12 – 24 hours (no longer is necessary). Rinse: Brush off cure and rinse duck under tap water to clean them (remove all salt and black bits). Pat dry with paper towels. Preheat oven to 100°C/210°F (80°C fan) with a shelf positioned in the middle of the oven. Roasting pan: Place duck in a small metal roasting pan with high sides. They should fit snugly; touching each other; but in a single layer. (Note 5) Cover with duck fat: Pour fat over duck. It should pretty much cover the legs. (Note 6) Heat fat in pan: Place pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Heat fat until bubbling energetically all across the surface (ie not just around the edges). Cover with paper: Turn off stove. Cover surface with baking / parchment paper; cut to size so it sits on the surface of the fat over the duck. Gently push down to remove air bubbles. Cover pan tightly with a double layer of foil. Slow cook: Carefully transfer to the oven. Cook for 8 hours. Check flesh: Remove one duck leg (gently). Turn over to check the flesh side – meat should be fall-apart tender. Leg should also give easily when pressure is applied to the joint (see video). Duck can be stored submerged in fat at this stage. The meat juice should be strained off first. Remove duck to a non-reactive container in which they fit snugly. (Note 7) Pour over cooled duck fat; leaving juice sediment behind. Ensure it fully covers the duck (push duck under while warm and pliable as needed; using tongs). Once fully cool; cover with lid and place in fridge (5 days) or freezer (3 months). Fat will solidify. To cook; heat duck gently in a container in microwave to melt the fat. Proceed with recipe. Preheat oven to 240°C/465°F (220°C fan). Place a rack over a deep roasting pan. Remove duck from fat: Remove duck from fat; allowing excess oil to drip off. Pat excess oil off with paper towels. Prepare for roasting: Pour 2.5cm / 1" of boiling water water into the roasting pan (steam keeps flesh moist). Place duck on rack; skin side up. Crisp skin: Roast duck for 40 minutes until the skin is a deep golden and crispy. Rotate pan as needed for even colour. (You won't have problems with fat smoking as it drips into the water) Serve: Rest briefly to cool; and serve! A classic French side dish for Duck Confit is Lentil Ragout. (pictured in post)
https://www.recipetineats.com/lentil-ragout-french-puy-lentils-side-dish/, Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sauté garlic; carrot and onion until softened – around 5 minutes. Cook off tomato paste: Add tomato paste; bay leaf and thyme. Cook 2 minutes. Add lentils; simmer 15 minutes: Add lentils; stock; salt and pepper. Stir; bring to simmer; then lower heat and simmer without a lid for 15 minutes until the lentils are soft (don't let them overcook so they become mushy!). Season: Stir through parsley. Taste and add more salt or pepper if needed. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/warm-french-goats-cheese-salad-salade-de-chevre-chaud/, Slice cheese: Cut goat's cheese if necessary to create ~ 1.25cm (1/2") thick rounds. Place flour; whisked egg and breadcrumbs in 3 separate; small bowls. Crumb cheese: Coat cheese in flour; shake off excess. Dip in egg; allow excess to drip. Coat with breadcrumbs; pressing to adhere. Place on plate and set aside. Toast nuts: Spread nuts in a layer on a tray. Toast in a 180C / 375F oven for around 5 minutes until they are lightly browned and smell toasty. Immediately transfer to a small bowl to cool. Alternatively; toast in a skillet over medium heat (walnuts will take longer than pine nuts; so best to do in separate batches). Cook bacon: Place bacon in a cold non-stick pan. Turn the stove to medium and let the pan warm up. Once the fat starts to melt; turn the heat to high. Stir and cook bacon until golden. Drain excess fat on paper towels. Dressing: Shake dressing ingredients in a jar. Begin assembling salad: Place lettuce in a bowl; casually arrange tomatoes; then sprinkle with nuts and bacon. Melt butter in a small non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Pan-fry cheese: Once butter is foaming; cook crumbed cheeses for 1 – 1 1/2 minutes on one side until golden. Carefully turn; cook other side for 1 minute until golden. Remove and drain on paper towels. Drizzle each salad with 2 tbsp of dressing. Arrange 2 crumbed cheeses on top of each salad. Sprinkle with chives. Serve immediately; while cheese is hot and melty inside!
https://www.recipetineats.com/brioche/, Bloom yeast (Note 1): In a small bowl; mix 1 tsp sugar; yeast and milk together. Cover with cling wrap and set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes until foamy. Dough making methods: Base recipe method uses a Stand Mixer. See Note 5 for faster food processor method. Make dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook; add the flour; eggs; salt; rest of the sugar and the foamy yeast. Mix on Speed 1 until ingredients are combined. Mixing Part 1: After the ingredients are combined; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 minutes then on Speed 2 for 10 minutes; (Yes really; 15 minutes; see Note 8!) Slow add butter: With the stand mixer still on Speed 2; drop butter cubes in gradually; over about 90 seconds to 2 minutes; giving the dough a chance to mix most of the butter in. (Note 9) Incorporate butter: Keep mixing until the butter is fully incorporated-  about 1 minute. Dough will be pasty and sticky! Mixing Part 2: Then mix on Speed 2 for 20 minutes; scraping down the sides of the bowl every now and then.  Dough goals (Note 8): At first the mixture it will be very pasty and stuck to the sides of the bowl. By the end; the dough should come together; caught up in the dough hook; and not be stuck on the sides of the bowl. Very soft; but able to pick it up. You should be able to do the "window pane" test using a walnut size piece (Note 10). If not; keep kneading! (Note 11 trouble shooting) Rise #1 (2 hrs): Shape the dough into a ball; put it back into the stand mixer bowl. Cover with cling wrap and put it in a warm place for 2 hours until it has doubled in size. Cut into 3: Punch the dough dough to release all the air. Scrape out onto a lightly floured work surface. Fold the outside of the dough in 6 times. Shape into a log then cut into 3 equal portions and shape into a ball (~225g/7.9oz per piece). Fridge (1.5 hrs): Line a deep container or roasting pan with baking/parchment paper lightly sprayed with oil. Place dough on paper; cover with cling wrap/lid and refrigerate for 1.5 hours (Note 12). Braid: Remove dough from fridge. Place on a lightly floured work surface and roll each piece into a 35cm/14" logs. Braid the logs; and tuck the ends under to make them tidy. Loaf pan: Spray a 21.5 x11cm (8.5 x 4.3") loaf pan well coated with oil spray; then place the dough in. Lightly spray cling wrap with oil; then cover the dough. Rise #2 (3 hrs): Rise in a warm place for 3 hours or until it is just over double in size. (Note 13) Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan) when dough is almost ready. Shelf position: Position shelf so loaf will sit in the lowest 1/3 of the oven. Egg wash: Brush the brioche surface very gently with whisked egg. Bake uncovered 15 min: Bake brioche for 15 minutes; uncovered; until a beautiful deep golden. Bake covered 20 min: Remove from oven. Loosely cover with foil. Bake for a further 20 minutes or until the internal temperature is 88°C/190°F. (Note 14) Turn out and cool: Immediately turn brioche out onto a rack. Cool for at least 45 minutes before slicing (or tearing!) to serve (still warm). Serving: Best served warm; with butter and lovely jams; the French way! Either slice warm loaf; or toast slices. (Note 16) See in post for more serving ideas – savoury; sweet; breakfast; lunch; dessert! The crust will be delicately crusty and flake gently when you slice it. It will be ultra soft inside; much softer than usual breads; with a pale yellow colour from the butter and eggs. Though traditionally sliced to serve; a unique characteristic is that if you tear the bread; it shreds like cotton candy. This is the sign off a well made traditional French brioche that you will not find in run-of-the-mill grocery store cheap brioche! Subtly sweet with a beautiful butter flavour (another thing store bought lacks!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/prawn-stir-fry/, Steam broccolini: Steam broccolini until crisp-tender; about 2 – 3 minutes (remember it will cook more in the stir fry). Set aside to drain and dry. Stir Fry Sauce: Put all Stir Fry Sauce ingredients except water into a bowl. Mix until cornflour is dissolved. Then stir in water.  Cook then remove prawns: Heat oil in a wok or large skillet on medium to medium-high heat. Add prawns and spread them in a single layer. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes; then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute until cooked through. Try not to make the prawns too golden (they are only lightly browned in stir fries). Remove prawns to a bowl. Set aside. Cook onion; garlic and ginger: Add more oil if the pan seems a bit dry. Still on medium-high heat; add onion and cook for 1 minute. Then add ginger and garlic and cook for another 1 minute until onion is starting to soften but not colour. Add snow peas; then broccolini: Add snow peas and toss until coated with oil. Then add broccolini and toss through. Add Sauce and thicken: Give the Sauce a stir (to dissolve cornflour settled at bottom); then pour into skillet. Cook; stirring; until sauce thickens to syrup consistency (about 1 minute) and coats the ingredients nicely.  Add prawns back in: Then add the prawns back in (including any juices in the bowl). Toss for another 30 seconds until prawns are warmed through.  Serve: Serve with rice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pakora-indian-vegetable-fritters/, Make batter: Place chickpea flour in a bowl with the spices (turmeric; cumin; coriander; fenugreek; chilli). Slow whisk in the water. Mix in Vegetables: Add potato; cauliflower; onion; ginger; chilli and coriander. Mix well with a wooden spoon. It should be a thick batter; almost paste-like. Preheat oven to 80°C/175°F – to keep cooked pakoras warm. Set a rack over a tray. Heat oil: Heat 4cm / 1.5" oil in a large heavy based pot to 180°C/350°F (Note 6). Form patties: Drop 2 tbsp of batter roughly formed into a patty shape into the oil. I use my hands (as is typical in India!) but you can also use 2 tablespoons (be careful of splash-age). Don't crowd the pot; it will lower the temperature too much. Fry pakoras: Fry 2 – 3 minutes until golden. Drain on paper towels. Keep cooked pakoras hot in the oven on a rack set over a tray. Serve: Serve pakoras with Coriander Mint Sauce or Minted Yogurt Sauce! Place ingredients in a small food processor or Nutribullet; or use a stick blender. Blitz until smooth.
https://www.recipetineats.com/twice-baked-potatoes-stuffed-jacket-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 220°C / 430°F (200°C fan). Place a rack on a tray (recommended but not critical). Prick potatoes: Wash; scrub and dry potatoes well. Prick each potato 8 times with a fork. Oil and salt: Put potatoes in a bowl; pour over oil and rub onto potatoes. Then sprinkle over salt and use your hands to coat. (Just do this as best you can. Some will stick; much will not!) Bake: Place potatoes on rack and bake for 75 minutes or until you can pierce with a small knife with no resistance. Cook bacon: Place bacon in a cold non-stick pan over medium heat. When the fat starts to melt; turn the heat up to high and cook bacon until golden. Drain on paper towels. Heat butter and cream: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Then add cream and heat until hot; but don't let it boil. (You could also do this in a microwave) Lower oven: Turn oven down to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Scoop out potato flesh: Allow potatoes to cool enough so you can handle them (or use a tea towel). Cut in half lengthwise and scoop out potato flesh; leaving 0.7cm (1/3") thick layer of potato still stuck to skin. Mash potato: Place potato flesh in a bowl and mash while hot until smooth. Add-ins: Add half the cheese (save the rest for topping); most of the bacon (save a bit for garnish); all the green onion; hot cream and butter; salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Stuff and top with cheese: Fill potato skins with the mashed potato mixture. Top with remaining cheese. Bake: Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the cheese is melted; golden and bubbly. Serve: Serve immediately; garnish with sour cream; reserved bacon and chives.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-kiev/, Garlic butter filling: Place ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined. Shape and chill butter: Scrape butter on to a small sheet of baking / parchment paper and roughly shape into 10 x 6cm / 4 x 2.4" rectangle. Refrigerate until firm; then cut in half lengthwise to form two batons. Pound chicken: Place chicken smooth side down between two freezer bags or paper (Note 3). Pound to an even 0.5 cm / 0.2" thickness using a meat mallet (Note 4 for tips!) Season: Sprinkle each side of the chicken with salt and pepper. Stuff and roll up chicken: Place a baton of butter in the middle. Trim edges if needed; then add trimmings into the centre. Fold sides in over the butter; then roll the chicken up starting from the bottom; finishing with the seam side down. Wrap and partially freeze: Wrap the chicken log in cling wrap; twisting the ends tightly to create a firm log shape. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes until the surface is fairly firm to touch; but not frozen solid. (Note 5) Crumb: Place egg; flour and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Coat chicken in flour; shaking off excess. Coat in egg; drip off excess. Then coat in breadcrumbs; pressing to adhere. Partial freeze: Place crumbed chicken in the freezer for 30 minutes until fairly firm to handle (but not frozen solid). Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F. Place a rack on a tray. Fry: Heat oil in a heavy based pot to 190°C / 375°F. Carefully place chicken in the oil and cook; turning once or twice; until golden (2 – 3 minutes). It will still be raw inside. Bake: Place chicken on a rack and bake for 15 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 65°C / 150°F. Pierce the top so you don't cause butter leakage! Rest for 2 minutes; then serve; sprinkled with a pinch of parsley if desired!
https://www.recipetineats.com/golden-turmeric-fish-indonesian/, Prep: Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Line a tray with baking / parchment paper. Quick fish marinade: Sprinkle fish with salt and drizzle with lime juice. Leave in fridge while making paste – just 10 minutes is fine. Turmeric Curry Paste: Place ingredients in a container that fits a stick blender. Then blend with stick until smooth; using extra water if needed until it is a paste consistency (ie. can be slathered on fish). Slather and bake: Smear paste onto surface of fish (not underside). Bake for 15 minutes until the internal temperature is 55°C/131°F (medium; just cooked but not raw at all; very juicy). Rest: Remove from oven and remove fish from tray (otherwise it keeps cooking). Rest 3 minutes; serve over rice with Sambal Tomat (below) and extra fresh coriander. Sambal Tomat Topping: Heat oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add tomato; chilli and salt. Sauté 2 minutes until tomato is slightly softened. Stir through coriander; serve over fish.
https://www.recipetineats.com/italian-almond-cookies-ricciarelli/, Preheat oven to 190°C/375°F (170°C fan). Line 2 trays with baking/parchment paper. Combine Dry Ingredients: Place the almond meal; sugar; zest; almond extract and salt in a bowl. Whisk together until zest and almond extract is evenly distributed. Add the cherries and set aside Beat eggs whites: Using an electric mixer or a whisk; beat the egg whites and honey to soft peaks (Note 5). About 2 minutes on Speed 8 of a handheld beater; or 1 1/2 minutes on Speed 6 of a stand mixer. Fold the beaten egg whites gently into the almond mixture. You will seemingly knock most of the air out of the meringue; that's ok! (You actually haven't 🙂 ). Place Extra egg white in a small bowl and whisk with a fork until foamy. Place flaked almonds in another bowl. Form 2.5cm/1" balls: Scoop up about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and shape into a rough ball (2.5cm/1" ball). I do this using 2 eating spoons – we don't need perfect balls here. Coat in egg whites: Drop the ball into foamy egg whites. Use 2 forks to turn to coat; then pick up and place in the flaked almonds. Almond coating: Coat cookies with the almonds; pressing them on to cover as completely as you can. Don't worry if you get some double layers or pieces sticking out – no need to be neat or thorough here! Bake 13 minutes: Place on prepared tray 2.5cm / 1" apart. Bake for 13-15 minutes until golden brown. Start checking at 12 minutes to be sure the nuts aren’t burning Cool: Transfer to rack to cool completely before serving. Store: Store in an airtight container. They last up to 10 days in a storage container or can be frozen
https://www.recipetineats.com/eggplant-parmigiana/, Preheat oven to 220°C / 430°F (200°C fan). Line three trays: Line three large trays with baking / parchment paper. Brush eggplant with oil: Brush eggplant slices on each side with oil. Bake 35 minutes: Arrange eggplant in a single layer on the trays and bake for about 35 – 45 mins or until browning and tender; turning the eggplant halfway. I put the trays on the top shelf; in the middle; then I put one tray on the floor of the oven. As each tray finishes; I remove the tray and move the others up. Cool: Remove from oven; leave on trays to cool. Sauté onions and garlic: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onions and garlic for 3 minutes until softened and just about to colour on the edges. Add remaining ingredients: Pour in the passata ; canned tomatoes; water; oregano and sugar. Stir and bring to a simmer. Simmer 30 minutes: Simmer uncovered for about 30 – 40 minutes; stirring occasionally; until thickened; adding the basil stalks halfway through cooking (so they don’t lose their flavour). The final consistency should be slightly thicker than a pasta sauce so it’s spreadable and not leaching liquid; but not too pasty either. Add extra water a little at a time if required during cooking if it gets too thick. Remove the basil stalks and discard. Season: Stir in salt and pepper. (Remember; we get salt from the parmesan too; so no need to go overboard here) Reduce oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan). Smear a little tomato sauce in the bottom of baking dish; 23 x 33cm / 9 x 13" (or thereabouts). Layer 1: Lay one third of the eggplant so it covers the base (some overlap is OK when layering eggplant). Spread 1/3 of the remaining sugo over eggplant. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the parmesan; and 1/3 of basil leaves. Layer 2: Repeat another 1/3 each of eggplant; tomato sauce; olive oil; basil and parmesan. Layer 3 (top layer): Repeat again with remaining eggplant; tomato sauce and some olive oil. Do not put basil on top layer (we will garnish after baking). Scatter with remaining parmesan; then all the mozzarella. Bake for 25 mins until bubbling and golden. Rest: Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes (easier to slice neatly). Scatter over remaining fresh basil leaves. Cut like lasagna and serve! (Optional: sprinkle with extra parmesan).
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-piccata/, Cut each breast into 3 pieces. Then place between 2 pieces of cling wrap or paper and pound to 1/2 cm / 0.2″ thickness. Drizzle chicken with 1/2 tbsp olive oil and spread with your fingers on both sides. Mix flour; parmesan; salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Coat chicken; pressing to adhere; then shaking off excess. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Then add butter and let it melt. Place 3 pieces of chicken in the skillet. Cook 3 – 4 minutes until golden; then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove onto plate; repeat with remaining chicken. Pour out and discard excess fat in skillet; then give it a quick wipe with paper towels (no need to clean thoroughly). Still on medium high heat; add wine. Let it simmer rapidly until it reduces by half – around 3 minutes. Add lemon and simmer 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Add cubed butter and swirl pan to make it melt but not go foamy. Sauce should be glossy; translucent and slightly thickened. Stir in capers and parsley. Serve chicken with Sauce; sprinkled with extra parsley if desired!
https://www.recipetineats.com/black-forest-cake/, Oven and cake pans: Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan). Grease 3 x 20cm (8”) cake pans with butter; line with parchment / baking paper. Sift dry ingredients: Combine dry ingredients by sifting the cocoa and plain flour into a bowl. Set aside. Beat eggs: Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment; or hand beater. Slowly add sugar: With the beater still going; slowly pour the sugar in over 45 seconds; then add the vanilla. Beat 7 minutes: Beat for 7 minutes more on speed 8; or until tripled in volume and pale in colour. Don't shortcut this step; this is what makes the cake rise (there's no baking powder used). Fold in dry ingredients: Add the flour and cocoa mixture to the batter; folding in with a spatula until just combined (a few streaks of flour remaining is fine). Be gentle here; we don't want to knock out the air bubbles. Fold in butter: Add the butter and fold gently through until just combined. Once you can no longer see any flour; stop stirring. Fill cake pans: Pour the batter into the three prepared pans. The batter should be fairly thin and pourable. Bake: Place into the oven and bake for 25 minutes; until springy to the touch and a skewer inserted into the cake centre comes out clean. (Note 5 regarding shelf placement) Cool: Remove from the oven. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before turning the cakes out onto a rack to cool completely. Drain cherries: Drain jar of cherries; reserving liquid. Cherry cornflour slurry: Measure out 1/4 cup (60ml) of the reserved cherry juice and mix with the cornflour to make a slurry. Set aside. Make cherry syrup: Place a medium pot over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and another 1/3 cup of reserved juice. Bring to a gentle simmer to dissolve the sugar. Stir in the cornflour slurry and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 minute; stirring; until it thickens into a thin syrup. Soak cherries; cool: Remove from the heat and stir in the kirsch. Pour the syrup over the drained cherries and allow to cool completely before using. Melt chocolate: Break up the block of chocolate and place in a microwave-safe bowl. Gently melt in microwave by heating over three 20 second bursts; stirring in between. Spread: Pour the melted chocolate over the back of a baking pan and spread out with a spatula as thinly as possible. Refrigerate for 3 – 4 minutes until the centre is just set. Scrape curls: Using something with a sharp; straight edge (I use a bench scraper; spatula or the back of a knife also works); hold it at a 45 degree angle and scrape along the tray away from you to create curls. Do a small test patch first. If the chocolate is too hard; the curls may break or flake (leave to soften slightly and try again). If the chocolate is too soft; the curls sag and won't roll (refrigerate more to harden). Having problems?? Don't worry! Just scrape to make shavings instead – it still looks amazing! Refrigerate: Carefully place curls on a plate and refrigerate until ready to use. Just prior to assembling; place cream; icing sugar and vanilla in a large bowl. Whip into pretty stiff peaks – about 5 minutes on high. Refrigerate until needed. Place one cake layer upside down on a serving platter (or cake decorating turn table; if you’re a pro! 🙂 ). Brush with cherry syrup: Brush the cake layer with 1/4 cup of the cherry syrup the cherries are soaking in. Cream layer: Spread with 1 cup of whipped cream; leaving a 1cm (1/2") border (the weight of the next cake layer gently pressed will push cream to edge). Layer cherries: Top the cream with half the cherries (in a single layer); using a slotted spoon to drain well (but don't pat dry; want the cherries juicy!). Repeat: Top with another cake layer; brush with 1/4 cup syrup; spread with 1 cup cream; top with remaining cherries; and place 3rd cake layer on top. Cover with cream: Reserve 1 1/2 cups whipped cream for piping cream decorations. Spread the remaining cream over the top and side of the cake. Pipe dollops around the edge of top using a large star-tipped nozzle. Top each dollop with a maraschino cherry. Chocolate shavings: Pile large chocolate curls in the middle (I stack in a tent shape like building a fire!). Use the smaller broken shavings to coat the base of the sides of the cake (using cold hands; scoop up shavings; press on side). Rest 4 hours+: Leave cake in the fridge for at least 4 hours; preferably overnight; to allow flavours to develop and syrup to really soak into the cake. Take out of fridge: Remove from fridge 30 minutes prior to serving (but be mindful of cream melting on hot days). Slice and serve proudly!
https://www.recipetineats.com/german-potato-salad/, Boil potatoes: Place the baby potatoes in a large pot of cold water with the salt. Bring to the boil then reduce heat. Simmer 10 minutes or until just cooked through but still slightly firm in the centre (they will continue cooking as they cool; you don't want to overcook them so they hold their shape). Slice: Drain and set aside to cool slightly; then slice into rounds about 0.7cm / ¼" thick. Cook bacon: Place bacon in a large; unheated non-stick pan or well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Turn the heat to medium. As the bacon heats up; the fat will start to melt. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook the bacon until it starts to turn golden – about 3 minutes. Cook onion: Turn heat down to medium. Add the red onion slices and cook 3 minutes or until the onion is soft. Add vinegar and sugar: Add the cider vinegar and sugar; bring to a simmer; scraping the base of the pan to dissolve all the golden bits stuck to the pan into the liquid. Add oil: Add the oil; and simmer for 2 minutes longer. The dressing is now ready. Toss potato through: Add potatoes and gently toss using two spatulas for 1 minute or so; until all the potatoes are well coated in the dressing and absorb some of the dressing. Check for salt: Taste and add more salt if you want (the bacon already should add enough). Layer potatoes: Pile about 1/4 of the potato on to a platter or in a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the green onion and dill. Top with another 1/4 of potato; sprinkle with more green onion and dill. Repeat until all used up. Serve! I love it served warm; but it's also terrific at room temperature!
https://www.recipetineats.com/german-cucumber-salad/, Peel cucumbers and finely slice into 2mm / 0.2" slices using a mandoline (or by hand and show off your knife skills!) Mix dressing ingredients in a small bowl. Toss cucumbers with dressing; then set aside for at least 4 hours or even overnight. The cucumbers will soften and leach juice which will thin the dressing to the right consistency. Serving: Toss well then transfer to bowl for serving. Serve chilled for the most refreshing flavour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-german-pork-knuckle-schweinshaxe-with-beer-gravy/, Prick skin: Poke lots of small holes all over the pork knuckle’s skin; using a small sharp knife or even a pin (eg. safety pin; sewing pin). Take care not to pierce through the fat into the flesh (Note 7). Vinegar: Brush (or rub) 1 tbsp of the vinegar on the pork flesh only; including inside cracks / crevices and meat under the skin where it meets the flesh (but do not peel skin back). Avoid getting vinegar on the skin. Stud with garlic: Make shallow incisions in the pork flesh (only) with a small knife then stuff with the garlic slivers. Seasoning rub: Pound the rub ingredients in a mortar and pestle until it's a coarse powder (or use a Nutribullet; spice grinder or similar). Rub seasoning on pork: Rub pork skin with olive oil. Then rub the seasoning mix all over the pork – on the flesh; skin; and getting into all the cracks and crevices. Skewer skin (secret for crispy skin! Note 8): Pull the skin down to stretch it tight so there's no creases. Then thread through 2 metal skewers in a "X" formation near the base of the knuckle. Pierce through skin 2cm / 0.8" from the base of the pork knuckle to hold the stretched skin in place. "Marinate" overnight: Place pork standing on a plate; then leave uncovered in the fridge overnight (Note 9). Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (160°C fan). Beer gravy: Put all beer gravy ingredients in a roasting pan (deep enough to hold all liquids and vegetables). Rack on pan: Place a rack over the pan. Place pork knuckle on rack; sitting upright. (Note 10) Slow roast: Roast for 2 hours 10 minutes; rotating tray half way. (If the liquid in the pan is getting too low and in danger of drying out; top with 1/2 cup of water at a time.) Roast until the internal temperature in the thickest part of meat reaches 85°C / 185°F. Remove knuckle from oven; transfer knuckle to a tray. Increase oven: Increase oven to 260°C / 500°F (240°C fan) (Note 11) Brush skin with vinegar: Brush skin with 1/2 the remaining 1 tbsp of vinegar. Place in oven for 30 minutes; rotating tray halfway and brushing with remaining vinegar. Skin should be crispy; dip golden and mostly bubbly. Rest: Rest 15 minutes before serving with German Beer Gravy! Strain liquid: Strain roasting pan juices into a saucepan. Ideally you should have around 1.5 – 2 cups. Thicken: Bring liquid to a simmer. Mix cornflour and water; then pour into liquid while stirring. Add sugar and salt to taste. Simmer: Simmer for 2 minutes or until it becomes a thin syrup consistency (German beer gravy should not be as thick as normal gravy; but quite runny). If it's too thick; add a touch of water. Too thin; simmer to reduce – it will thicken. Serve with pork knuckle!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pide-turkish-flat-bread/, Bloom yeast: Mix yeast with 2 tbsp warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap; leave for 10 minutes until foamy. Make dough: Mix together flour and salt in a large bowl or stand mixer bowl. Add the yeast mixture; olive oil and remaining 2/3 cups water. Mix together with a wooden spoon. Once the flour is mostly incorporated; switch to your hands and bring it together into a dough. Knead: Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour; then knead for 8 to 10 minutes by hand OR 3 minutes on speed 6 of a stand mixer. Dough is kneaded enough when it's smooth and does not break when stretched – see photos video for before/after comparison. (Note 8) Rise 1: Shape into a ball. Smear inside of used bowl with a bit of olive oil; place dough inside. Cover with cling wrap and rise in warm place for 1.5 hours; or until doubled in size. (Note 9) Rise 2: Punch dough down to fully deflate; then divide into 2 equal pieces. Pull the sides down and tuck underneath so the top is smooth; underside is bunched up. Shape into ball and place on a lightly floured tray; smooth side up. Sprinkle surface with flour; then cover with damp tea towel. Rise 1 hour until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 240°C/465°F (220°C fan). Place shelf on the top and middle. Roll: Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into an oval shape 40cm/16" long and 20cm/8" wide (widest point). Prepare 2 trays: Sprinkle 1/4 tsp semolina on each tray; 40cm/16" long and 15cm/6" wide. (Note 10) Top Pide: Place a rolled out dough on the semolina. Sprinkle with cheese; then sprinkle chosen Topping evenly across the surface; leaving a 2cm / 4/5" border all around. Fold dough: Brush the ends with water. Pinch ends together to seal then fold the sides of the pide in. Bake: Bake 15 minutes; switching trays halfway; until the crust is golden. Egg option: Bake pide for 10 minutes; then crack the egg on top and return to oven for 5 minutes. This applies to all Pide – egg can be added for any of them! Top & Serve: Sprinkle with toppings of choice. (Note 11 for combos I used). Cut into 3cm / 1.3" slices and serve! Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion for 3 minutes until translucent. Add spinach; cook until just wilted (add in batches if necessary). Stir in cumin; salt & pepper. Cool before using. Roughly chop; then turn the sausage into mince (ground meat) by using a Nutribullet or food processor. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook garlic and onion for 3 minutes until soft. Add lamb and cook until it changes from pink to brown. Add tomato paste; Baharat; cumin; salt; pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Add capsicum; tomato and lemon juice; then cook over medium heat until most of the liquid evaporates (a couple of minutes usually; though depends on juiciness of tomato). Cool before using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pork-tenderloin-with-creamy-mustard-sauce/, Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Place a rack over a tray (for resting the cooked meat). Season pork: Sprinkle the tenderloins all over with salt and pepper. Sear pork: Heat oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Sear pork all over until golden. This takes around 5 minutes (I sear 4 sides). Bake (Note 5): Transfer the skillet with the pork in it to the oven. Bake for 12 – 15 minutes or until an instant read thermometer reads 65°C / 149°F. This will have a blush of pink; a perfect medium for optimum juiciness. (For no pink at all; add 3 minutes cooking and target an internal temperature of 68°C / 155°F.) Rest: Remove pork from skillet and transfer to the resting rack for 5 minutes. Creamy Mustard Sauce: Return same skillet to the stove over medium heat. Add cream and both mustards. Mix well; scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve any golden bits stuck to the base of the pan into the sauce (free flavour!). Once it becomes hot but not simmering; stir in salt; pepper; tarragon and parsley. If the sauce seems too thick; thin with a little water as needed. No need to simmer; the sauce is done! Serve: Slice into 2 – 2.5cm (0.8 – 2") slices. Serve with Creamy Mustard Sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/tuna-steak/, Prepare resting tray: Place a rack on a tray. (Note 3) Oil and season tuna: Drizzle half the oil over the tuna. Smear over one side; then sprinkle with half the salt and pepper. Flip and repeat. Heat skillet: Heat skillet (preferably a skillet with grille lines) over high heat until smoking hot. The hotter; the better! Oil skillet (if required): If your skillet is not well-seasoned; brush skillet with olive oil or take pan off stove and spray with any oil (SAFETY WARNING! Note 4) Cook first side: Place tuna steak in the skillet (I do one at a time for best results; Note 5) and cook for 45 seconds. Rotate for grill lines:  Turn steak 45 degree. Continue cooking another 45 seconds. Cook other side: Flip tuna carefully; then leave for 1 minute or until the internal temperature in the middle reads 48°C / 118°F (Note 6). Rest: Remove tuna from skillet and place on rack. Rest for 5 minutes – it will cool down almost to room temperature. This is desirable for easier slicing and better eating (Note 7) Serve! See Note 2 for sauce options. Slice; if desired (Note 7): Place tuna on a board with criss-crossing grill lines facing up. Slice the tuna into 4 or 5 thick slices; holding the edges with your fingers as needed to ensure the seared surface doesn't crumble. Transfer to serving plate and separate the slices slightly so they insides are just visible; or on an a slightly angle; overlapping each other. Sauce Vierge: Spoon the Sauce Vierge over steaks; leaving small piles of tomato here and there on the tuna slices; and a few on the plate. Other sauce options: See Note 2. Finishing: Drizzle with a bit of olive oil. It looks beautiful as it is; but if you want to raise the bar even higher; add a few small sprigs of chervil and some edible flowers!
https://www.recipetineats.com/sauce-vierge/, Mix: Mix ingredients in a bowl. Taste and add more salt if you want (depends how salty the food you are putting it on is). Uses: Use at room temperature as a salsa / sauce; piled onto fish (such as Tuna Steak); other seafood; grilled or steamed vegetables; chicken; pork; over pasta; piled onto bread; or even as a dip for scooping up with crostini or corn chips! You can also warm the sauce if you wish: Gently heat in a small pot and warm to blood temperature. Do not simmer or boil or you'll lose the freshness! Storage: Use immediately on making; or the next day. Keep in a very airtight container and allow to come to room temperature before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/croque-monsieur-french-ham-cheese-sandwich/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Heat milk and cream: Place milk and cream in a saucepan over medium heat. Heat until steaming; but don't let it boil. Set aside. Make roux: Melt butter in a separate small saucepan over medium heat; then turn the heat down to low. Add flour and cook; stirring almost constantly; for 3 minutes. Don't let it brown. Add hot milk: While stirring; add half the milk. Once incorporated into the roux; mix in remaining milk; nutmeg; salt and pepper. Thicken: Mix for 30 seconds to a minute or until it thickens into a spreadable and soft butter-like consistency (ie. not runny). If you have lumps; whisk until gone. Remove from heat (it is OK if it cools). Spread with Bechamel: Spread half the béchamel over the 4 slices of bread; as though you are buttering them to make normal sandwiches! (Reserve half the béchamel for topping) Cheese + Dijon: Top two pieces of bread with 2 slices of gruyere or Swiss cheese each (fold as needed to make them fit). Then spread the cheese with half the Dijon Mustard (this might sound weird; but see in post for why we do this!). Ham + Dijon: Top with ham; then spread ham with remaining Dijon mustard. Top each of the two slices with 2 more slices of cheese (again; folding as needed); then close sandwiches with the other slices. Melt butter in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Place sandwiches in the skillet; and cook for 2 minutes; pressing down lightly with an egg flip or spatula; until a deep golden brown. Turn and cook the other side until golden brown. Transfer to a baking tray. Topping: Slather remaining béchamel thickly on the upper pieces of bread. Sprinkle with Gruyere; then parmesan. Bake and broil: Bake 15 minutes; then switch to the grill/broiler for 3 minutes and grill until the top is golden and bubbling. Immediately transfer to warmed serving plates; with knives and fork for serving (it's too messy to eat with hands.) For a traditional French bistro experience; add a side of fries and leafy greens lightly dressed in French Dressing or a basic vinaigrette. Devour and weep with joy! (Over the sandwich that is; not the salad!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/ratatouille/, Sweat eggplant: Place eggplant in a colander set over a bowl. Sprinkle with salt; toss with hands. Leave for 30 minutes to sweat (no need to wipe off water that beads on surface). Make tomato puree: Place tomato in a blender; food processor or other appliance of choice. Blitz until smooth. (No need to do this if using passata or crushed tomato.) Cook eggplant: Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add eggplant and cook for 4 to 5 minutes; stirring regularly; until it's golden on the surface but still somewhat firm and raw inside. Transfer to a large pot. Cook onion and garlic: In the same skillet; add another 1 tbsp olive oil. Add onion and garlic with a pinch of the salt. Cook for 3 minutes until onion is soft with a hint of golden on the edges. Add to pot holding eggplant. Cook capsicum: Add another 1 tbsp of olive oil and cook the capsicum with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes. It should still be firm inside. You won't get much colour on the capsicum; this is OK. Add to pot. Cook zucchini: Add another 1 tbsp olive oil and cook the zucchini with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes. Make sure it stays firm (ie. raw inside). Like the capsicum; it won't go golden. Add to pot. Add remaining ingredients to pot: Turn the stove under the pot to medium-high. Add tomato; thyme; olives; remaining salt and all the pepper; and mix. Once the mixture is hot; reduce heat to a low simmer. Braise: Cook for 20 – 25 minutes with the pot lid off; stirring every now and then; until all the vegetables are cooked through and the liquid has reduced. The mixture should be thick enough so you can pile it on a plate (ie. not watery); but still very moist and juicy. Basil and salt: Taste and add more salt if needed; vegetables can taste bland if not enough salt is added. Stir through basil then serve immediately; drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of extra basil on top; if desired. Serve as a main with crusty bread; or as a side dish. See above recipe card for more ideas!
https://www.recipetineats.com/drip-dog-birthday-cake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Cake pans: Grease and line the base of 2 x 15cm (6") cake pans that are 7.5cm (3") deep (Note 3 for other cake pan sizes). Mix wet ingredients: Whisk together eggs; peanut butter; oil; honey and milk (small peanut butter lumps are ok). Add dry ingredients: Stir in carrot. Add flour and baking soda; stir until just combined (over-mixing = hard cake = sad birthday pooch!) Fill cake pans: Divide batter between cake pans; spread and smooth surface. Bake: Bake 30 minutes or until skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool on racks.  Level and halve: Trim the mound off the top of each cake to make the tops flat. Then cut each cake horizontally in half using a serrated knife so you have four; even; flat cake layers. Frost per below. Cook potatoes: Boil; steam or microwave potato until very soft. Whip: Whip potato and yoghurt with an electric beater until fluffy and smooth as possible –  about 1 1/2 minutes on medium speed (speed 5).  Adjust thickness: Use water as needed to loosen frosting to a soft; spreadable consistency (like human buttercream frosting). Use while warm – it "sets" and gets harder when it cools; Note 4.  White and blue frosting: Use uncoloured frosting to frost between cake layers and sandwich them. Keep remaining frosting to be coloured and used to frost the surface. Mix ingredients in a small bowl; starting with 1 tablespoon milk. The frosting should be thin enough so it will spread quite smoothly on the top of the cake; but thick enough so the drips you make down the side will hold their form. (Do a test on a straight-walled glass). Adjust thickness with more cornflour / cornstarch (for thicker) or more milk (for thinner). Sandwich layers: Place one cake layer on a turntable or serving platter. Spread with 3/4 cup white frosting. Top with another layer of cake; spread with 3/4 cup frosting; then repeat once more and top with the 4th cake layer. Colouring frosting: Colour the remaining frosting blue using blue gel. To achieve the colour pictured; dip a toothpick into gel container and smear colouring on the surface of the potato. Dip a clean toothpick again into the gel and repeat (you need two dips to get enough colour into frosting). Mix frosting until colour is uniform. Frosting surface with blue: Frost the top and sides of the cake with the blue frosting; spreading it as smoothly as you can. Drip Frosting: Spoon 2 – 3 tablespoons of Drip Frosting on the top of the cake and spread carefully to the edge; ensuring you don't coax it over the edge. Now scoop up a teaspoon of the Drip Frosting  and "drip" it down the side of the cake from the top edge. Repeat all around; making drips of different lengths. Decorate: Decorate cake as desired with decorations that you want to stick to the frosting. I used silver; blue and white balls. Set frosting: Immediately refrigerate for at least 3 hours to make the Drip Frosting set. (Also; the silver balls will sweat on the Drip Frosting unless it sets quickly). Keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Happy birthday to your pooch!!!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creme-brulee/, Vanilla bean: Split vanilla pod down the middle and scrape the seeds out using a small knife. Place into saucepan with cream and the empty vanilla pod. Infuse cream: Simmer uncovered over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside to infuse for 1 hour with lid on (you can skip this step if using paste; just let it cool to lukewarm). Remove vanilla pod. Skim off any skin that has formed on the surface. Preparation: Preheat oven to 130°C/265°F (120°C fan). Place 4 x ⅔ cup / 150 ml empty ramekins in a baking pan with high enough sides that enough water can be poured in to come halfway up ramekins. Boil water: Boil a kettle of water. Whisk egg yolks and sugar: Whisk yolks and sugar until just well combined. Don't whisk too much; as this can create bubbles. Add cream: Pour cream into eggs and gently stir to combine. Divide mixture between ramekins with a soup ladle. Water bath: Pour in enough boiling water so it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (If you have too much water; ramekins will float around – not good!) Bake: Bake for 35 – 40 minutes; or until the custard is set but there is still a slight wobble when you GENTLY give the ramekin a little shake. Chill: Remove ramekins from water. Leave to cool; then refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably overnight (up to 3 days is OK).  Blow torch method: Sprinkle 1/2 tsp sugar over the surface of each crème brûlée. Use a blow torch to melt and caramelise the sugar. Serve immediately. Grill / broiler method: Crème brûlée should be first refrigerated overnight. Preheat grill to high. Place crème brûlée under grill for 1 minute or until sugar is melted and caramelised. Refrigerate afterwards for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour (to reset custard immediately under toffee); then serve. Crème brûlée perfect texture: The texture should be like a very thick yogurt; rather than set so it is sliceable like cake or even like a soft set jelly. When you take a scoop; the custard should barely hold together; but shouldn't be melting or running. When you take a bite the custard should literally just melt in your mouth.
https://www.recipetineats.com/whole-baked-fish/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Line a tray with parchment/baking paper. Trim fins: Cut all fins off the fish using scissors – both fins on the side; and the fins on the back and underside of the fish (but not the tail). Slash flesh: Cut 3 slashes on each side of the fish; cutting through flesh down to the bone (see photos in post and/or video; helpful!).  Stuff fish (Note 2): Sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper inside the cavity of the fish. Scatter the cavity with garlic slices; then stuff with parsley and dill. Layer lemons on top of herbs. Tie fish (Note 3): Using kitchen string make 3 ties to hold fish together. Season skin: Sprinkle remaining salt and pepper on the skin (both sides); including a bit on the head of the fish. Then drizzle with olive oil. Rub all over the fish; including in the slashes. Bake 20 minutes (Note 4): Place fish on prepared tray. Bake for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature is 55°C/131°F (insert thermometer in the thickest part of the fish; not against the bone). Alternatively; use a small knife at one of the cut slits in the fish to prise a bit of meat gently away from the spine. If it flakes away from the bone without resistance; it's done. Rest: Remove from oven; transfer to serving platter and leave it to rest for 5 minutes. The internal temperature will rise to 58°C / 136.5F ("medium"; ie. just-cooked and not raw at all; very juicy and moist). Serve with Garlic & Dill Butter Sauce on the side. Either pour over the butter just prior to serving the fish; or let everyone help themselves. See this video by Serious Eats for a concise tutorial for how to carve and serve a whole roasted fish. Melted butter: Place butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Once melted; add garlic and cook; stirring; for 45 seconds to 1 minute until it smells ridiculously good and you're salivating! Add dill: Remove from heat. Stir in dill. Use per recipe.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cauliflower-cheese/, Preheat oven to 220°C / 430°F (200°C fan). Toss cauliflower in oil; salt and pepper. Spread on a large tray. Roast 20 minutes (don't turn). Cauliflower should still be a bit firm; but with some colour on them. Remove from oven. Turn oven down to 180°C/350°F. Heat milk: Heat milk and cream until hot – either on the stove or in microwave. Make roux: Melt butter in a large saucepan or small pot over medium heat. Add flour and cook; stirring regularly; for 3 minutes. Add milk: While stirring; pour in half the milk. Once the roux is dissolved into the milk (mixture will thicken); stir in remaining milk. Stir on the heat for 1 minute – mixture should be thick enough to coat a wooden spoon. Add cheese: Turn the stove off; but leave the pot on the turned off stove. Stir in salt; nutmeg and both cheeses. The cheese will thicken the mixture so it's like a thick sauce. Mix in cauliflower: Add cauliflower and toss to coat in the sauce. Fill baking dish: Transfer mixture to a 2L / 2qt baking dish (30 x 20 x 5cm / 12 x 8 x 2"). Top with cheese: Sprinkle over gruyère followed Red Leicester cheese. Bake at 180°C/350°F for 30 minutes until the cheese is melted; and cauliflower is bubbly and golden. Serve: Sprinkle with parsley if desired. Stand 5 minutes then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pistachio-pear-tart/, Make and bake Tart Crust; then fully cool before using. Peel; remove stem; then halve and core (I use melon baller). Keep peeled pears in a separate bowl of water with a squeeze of lemon juice (to stop them going brown). Place 2L / 2 quarts water; sugar and vanilla in a pot and bring it to a boil. Lower heat so the water is rippling but there are no large bubbles breaking on surface. Beads of tiny bubbles is fine. Place pears into pot; poach for 20 – 25 minutes until pears are soft all the way through. Check with a knife on the side; not top of pears. (Note 5). Once cooked; drain on paper towels until fully cool. Mix butter and sugar with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add eggs one at a time; whisking each until fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in pistachio until fully incorporated. Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Spread pistachio mixture in tart crust; and smooth the surface. Place 7 pear halves on top in a radial pattern with the narrow ends pointing inwards. Cut the 8th half so it will fit in the centre; and place in middle of tart. Slightly push pears in so that they're partially submerged (see reference photo / video above). Bake for 35 minutes. Remove from oven. While still warm; brush with apricot jam glaze to make it shiny; then sprinkle with chopped pistachios. Fully cool; then slice to serve. It's beautiful just served as-is. Optional extras: a dollop of creme fraiche (pictured in post); whipped cream or ice cream.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sweet-tart-crust-french-pastry-pate-sucree/, Mix Dy Ingredients: Whisk together flour; icing sugar; salt and almond meal in a bowl. Add butter: Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles breadcrumbs. (Note 4). Add egg: Mix with a rubber spatula until it becomes too hard to stir anymore; then use your hands to bring it together into a dough. Bring dough together: Turn dough out onto a work surface; then knead to bring together into a smooth ball. Flatten into a 2cm / 0.8" thick disc. Wrap with cling wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Unwrap chilled dough. Place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out into a 32cm / 13″ round (3mm / 1/8″ thick). Line tart tin: Roll pastry lightly on to a rolling pin (ie. so it wraps around itself). Then unroll it gently over the tart tin. Fit pastry: Adjust the pastry to fit into the tart tin; fitting into the corner; taking care not to stretch it (causes shrinkage during bake). Trim excess dough: Roll the rolling pin over tart tin to trim excess dough. Pictured tart tin is 24 x 3 cm / 9.5 x 1.2" – you can use any up to this size. Prick the base of the pastry 30 times with a fork. Not all the way through – just make a light prick on the surface. Chill pastry in tart tin for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Baking beads: Cover pastry with 2 sheets of baking paper (parchment paper); in a "X" arrangement. Fill with baking beads (or 2 cups dry raw rice or beans). Baking times for a Par Baked Tart to be used for tarts that are baked for > 30 minutes once the filling is added into the cooked tart shell. Bake 15 minutes the remove from oven. Use excess paper to remove baking beads. Bake uncovered 5 minutes: Return tart crust to oven for 5 minutes. Pastry should be light golden; crispy on surface; but slighty undercooked inside (will finish cooking once filled and baked again).  Use these baking times if the tart shell is to be used for raw fillings (ie tart not baked once crust is filled) OR fillings that are baked for < 25 minutes. Bake 15 minutes the remove from oven. Use excess paper to remove baking beads. Bake uncovered 10 minutes: This will fully cook the pastry through and give it nice colour which we need as the pastry won't cook through in less than 25 minutes once filled. Cool: Remove then cool in tart tin before filling (this ensures crust stays crispy once filled); then baking again if filling needs to be cooked (like this Pistachio Frangipane Pear Tart).  Make ahead up to 3 days; suitable for baking once filled.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mushroom-soup/, Chopping mushrooms: Cut mushrooms into 4 slices; then dice into 3 or 4 pieces. Saute onion and garlic: Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes until softened; but not golden. Cook mushrooms: Add mushrooms and cook for 10 minutes; stirring regularly. Do not try to brown; they won't as the pot is too crowded but we do not need colour. Simmer 15 min: Add vegetable stock; salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; then lower heat to medium and simmer gently for 15 minutes without a lid. Cream: Stir in cream (or crème fraiche); then simmer for another 5 minutes. Blitz: Transfer to a blender (do in batches; if necessary). Remove the cap from the feeding hole in the blender lid (Note 5); cover the hole with a folded tea towel. Blend until completely smooth. Return to pot; simmer for a minute or two until bubbles caused by blending largely subside and soup is hot. Serve: Ladle into bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil or cream; croutons and parsley or (if you're feeling a bit fancy); chervil. Don't forget bread for dunking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-vegetable-stock/, Simmer 2 hours: Place all ingredients in a large pot. Bring to simmer over high heat; then reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 hours without a lid. The water should not be bubbling; it should just ripple gently. Stock should reduce by about half. Strain; pressing juices out of the vegetables. You should have 1 litre / 1 quart (4 cups) of stock. If you have much more than this; return the strained liquid into the pot and simmer to continue to reduce. How to use: Use in place of store-bought stock in any recipe – 1:1 ratio. Storage: Keeps in the fridge for 5 days; or freeze for 3 months. I usually freeze in 1 cup portions in jars; small ziplock bags (freeze flat for efficient use of space and faster defrosting) or in plastic containers.
https://www.recipetineats.com/korean-bbq-marinated-beef-short-ribs-galbi/, Make Marinade: Whisk Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinade 24 hours: Place beef in a ziplock bag; glass or ceramic container. Pour over Marinade; mix well to coat. Cover and marinade for 24 hours. Remove beef from Marinade; discard Marinade. BBQ – Heat on high until smoking hot; then brush grills with vegetable oil. Lay beef on BBQ and cook for 2 minutes on one side until caramelised. Turn and cook the other side until caramelised. Remove; loosely cover with foil; cook remaining beef. Stove – Cut beef strips into pieces that will fit your skillet. Heat skillet with oil over high heat. Add beef and cook for 2 minutes until caramelised; then turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes. Garnish beef with sesame seeds and green onions if desired. You don't need a sauce for this one – it is literally dripping with flavour! Pictured in post with Kimchi Fried Rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-slow-roasted-pork-belly/, Dry skin overnight: Place pork belly on a plate. Pat skin dry with paper towels. Leave uncovered in fridge overnight to dry out the skin. (If you don't have time; pat the skin dry as best you can). Preheat oven to 140°C/285°F (120°C fan). Season flesh: Drizzle flesh (only) with 1 tsp oil. Sprinkle over 1/2 tsp salt; the pepper and fennel powder. Rub all over the flesh; including on the sides; being sure you get right into all the cracks and crevices. Wrap in foil: Place 2 pieces of foil on a work surface. Put the belly in middle of foil; skin side up. Fold the sides in to enclose the belly; forming an open box; pinching corners to seal tightly and make it as snug as possible. Place meat on a tray. Season skin: Pat skin dry with paper towels. Rub with 1/2 tsp oil then sprinkle remaining 1/2 tsp salt evenly all over the skin surface; from edge to edge. Slow roast 2 1/2 hours: Place in the oven and roast for 2 1/2 hours. After 1 1/2 hours; remove and tighten the foil (pork will have shrunk); and continue cooking. This keeps the pork fat level up as high as possible; and the flesh protected so it stays moist. Increase heat: Remove pork from oven; then increase heat to 240°C/465°F (all oven types). Level pork: Remove pork from foil and place on a rack set over a tray (using rack is best; but optional). Use scrunched up balls of foil stuffed under pork to prop up so the skin surface is as level and horizontal as possible (see photos in post). 30 minutes on high heat! Place the pork back in the oven for 30 minutes; rotating after 15 minutes as needed; until the crackling is deep golden; puffy and crispy all over. If some patches are browning faster; protect with foil patches. ⚠️ Open oven with care as it will be smokey – open your windows! Rest 10 minutes: Remove pork from oven. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serving: Slice into 2cm / ⅘"-thick slices using a serrated knife. Pictured in post with Apple Sauce and Vermouth Jus; with a side of Cauliflower Puree (Note 2)!  See directions in post for how to plate it up as pictured (fine dining style!); as well as a list of more sauce options.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vermouth-jus-sauce/, Melt butter in a skillet over medium low heat. Add eschalot and cook for 4 – 5 minutes; until softened and sweet. Do not allow to colour. Add vermouth and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let it simmer; scraping the base of the pan to dissolve any fond (stuck caramelised bits) into the liquid; until the liquid is almost totally evaporated. The alcohol cooks out during this step. Add beef stock and let it simmer for 6 to 7 minutes until it reduces by 3/4 (exact time will differ depending on stove strength and pan size). Add cream and simmer for a further 4 minutes or until it changes from a pale cream colour to a medium brown colour. Season with salt and pepper; and taste. If it tastes a bit thin; continue to reduce. Strain sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. If you have much more than 100ml / 3.5 oz jus once strained; then return to pan and simmer on low for a bit longer. (Be sure to use a rubber spatula so you don’t waste a drop!). Serving: Jus is an intensely-flavoured sauce and so is used sparingly (allow 1.5 tbsp – 2 tbsp max per serve). Restaurants will typically serve it already poured with the meat; rather than a jug for people to serve themselves. Drizzle it on the plate around or on protein using a spoon (pan seared or roast slices). See in post for some ideas; including how I plated up the Crispy Pork Belly slices using this jus.
https://www.recipetineats.com/apple-sauce/, Place sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat. Shake pan to spread sugar. Leave for a few minutes until the edges start melting and turning golden; then swirl the pan to spread the caramel/sugar to encourage even melting (do not stir; sugar may crystallise). Once the sugar is all melted; add apple and vinegar. Mix; and cook for 8 – 10 minutes; stirring occasionally; until the apple is completely soft. Add the butter; stir it in until mostly melted. Blitz until smooth using a stick blender (tilt saucepan if needed to ensure head is completely submerged to avoid splattering). Serve with: Slow-roasted crispy pork belly or any pork dishes. Also great for sweet applications – see in post for more ideas! 
https://www.recipetineats.com/red-potato-salad-with-bacon-and-corn-no-mayo/, Dressing: Shake Dressing in a jar. Cook potato: Bring a large pot of water to the boil and add salt. Add potato. Bring it back up to the boil; then cook for 5 minutes or until just soft. Keep an eye on them – sliced potatoes cook quickly; and if they overcook they will break when tossing. Drain and marinate: Drain potatoes; then transfer them to a bowl. Handle gently – the shape of these potatoes make them prone to breaking while hot (they're firmer when cool). Pour over 3/4 of the dressing; add eschalots and toss very gently. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes. Cook bacon: Place bacon in a cold non-stick pan then turn the stove to medium high. As the pan heats; the bacon fat will melt so there's no need for oil! Cook bacon; stirring constantly (to avoid spitting!); until golden or to your taste. Drain on paper towels. Cook corn: Meanwhile; cook corn cob using one of these methods. Either grill on the BBQ (10 min on high) or directly over the gas flame on your stove (6 min; direct contact with flame); until nicely charred and corn is cooked. Otherwise; cut the corn off the kernels then pan fry on high heat in residual bacon fat or 1 tbsp olive oil until charred. Cut off kernels: Cut kernels off cob; trying to keep of the kernels in clumps (looks nice!). (Note 4 for my method) Make salad: To the same bowl; add all the corn; half the bacon and most of the green onion. Toss gently; then transfer to serving bowl. Scatter with reserved bacon and green onion; drizzle over remaining Dressing. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-cashew-chicken-stir-fry/, Sauce: Mix all the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Cook cashews: Heat oil over medium heat in a wok or large skillet. Add cashews and cook for 5 minutes until they become a dark golden colour and crunchy (yep; you might have to eat one to check!). Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon. Garlic & onion: Turn heat up to high. Add garlic and onion. Cook for 30 seconds. Chicken: Add chicken. Cook for 1 minute until the outside changes from pink to white. White part of green onion & chilli: Add white part of green onions and chilli. Cook for 1 minute until chicken is just cooked through. Add Sauce: Cook for 1 minute until it reduces down to a syrup; coating the chicken nicely. Green onion & cashews: Add green part of green onions and cashews. Toss for 30 seconds. Serve: Transfer to serving dish. Serve with jasmine rice; or other rice of choice; garnished with extra red chilli (if you can handle the heat!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/easter-cake/, Level: Trim the top of cakes if required/desired to make the layers level (for aesthetic purposes). Chill: Place cake layers in fridge until thoroughly chilled (this makes it easier to frost so crumbs don't go everywhere). Toast coconut: Preheat oven to 160°C/325°F (140°C fan). Spread coconut on a tray. Bake 6 – 10 minutes; stirring every couple of minutes; until golden. (Bake time depends on sugar level; so keep an eye on it). Cool. Cream butter: Beat butter in a stand mixer on Speed 8 for 3 minutes until it changes from yellow to almost white.  Add icing sugar in 3 batches: Add icing sugar in 3 batches; starting the mixer on speed 1 until partially incorporated; then increasing until it's mostly mixed in. Vanilla; salt; and beat 2 mins: Add vanilla and salt; then beat on Speed 8 for 2 minutes until almost white; and it's beautifully fluffy. Colour (Note 4): Remove 1 tbsp frosting into a small bowl. Add 1 drop of blue gel; mix in. Add 1 teaspoon of coloured frosting back into main frosting; beat until incorporated (scrape down sides as needed). Add more coloured frosting 1 teaspoon at a time until desired tone is achieved. Mix cocoa and boiling water. Frosting: Spread 3/4 cup frosting between each cake layer; then using remaining frosting for side and surface (I usually have ~1/2 cup frosting leftover; but better safe than sorry!). Speckles: Place something behind cake as a backboard for the speckling mess! Dip toothbrush in cocoa mixture; then use fingers to flick speckles onto cake surface – sides and top. (Hint: Practice in sink first). TIP: When doing top of cake; angle toothbrush 45 degrees down NOT over cake; to avoid accidental big drips. Coconut Nest: Pile coconut in the middle to form a "nest" then pile a mound of eggs in it. Coconut Rim: Place a mound of coconut all along the base of the cake; then dot with Easter Eggs. Bask in praise: Take proudly to table and bask in the compliments!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beetroot-cured-salmon-gin-or-vodka/, Make beetroot cure: Place the beetroot; sugar; salt plus the gin cure OR vodka cure ingredients in a food processor. Blitz until pureed like a smoothie – about 15 seconds on high; scraping down the sides as needed. Line container: Use a container into which the salmon fits snugly; but flat (Note 3). Line with two large pieces of cling wrap; overlapping one horizontally and one vertically; like a cross (so it will wrap salmon completely). Place salmon in beetroot: Spread beetroot mixture on the cling wrap inside the container. Lay salmon on top; flesh side down. Press down lightly but not too firm – flesh should be fully in contact with beetroot; not base of container. 48-hour cure: Wrap up securely with the cling wrap; cover with lid (or seal container with more cling wrap). Refrigerate 48 hours (do not turn). Rinse: Unwrap salmon; rinse off beetroot mixture; then pat dry. Recommended – rest overnight: If time permits; place washed and dried salmon in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight. This allows the salt to redistribute more evenly throughout the salmon. (Note 4) Horseradish cream: Mix ingredients together until smooth. Cucumber Ribbons: Use a potato peeler to make long thing ribbons lengthwise down the cucumber. Toss with vinegar and salt; set aside for 10 minutes. Drain liquid; toss with dill; transfer to serving dish. Fried crispy capers: Heat oil in a small pan to 190°C/375°F. Fry capers for 30 sec/1 min until crisp. Drain on paper towels and cool. Crispy bread: Brush bread lightly on each side with olive oil; then bake in a 180°C/350°F oven for 8 minutes; turning halfway; until crisp. Plating: Place uncut salmon on a serving platter (one you can cut on). Scatter salmon with crispy capers and fresh dill. Place crispy bread and horseradish cream on the side; along with fresh lemon if using. To serve: Cut thin slices down to the skin (but not through it). Pivot the knife blade so it's almost parallel to the skin and cut the each slice carefully away from the skin (you cannot eat the skin). Smear crispy bread with horseradish cream; top with salmon; a few capers; and sprig of fresh dill. Devour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/rosemary-garlic-rack-of-lamb-recipe/, Marinate lamb: Mix marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag (Note 2). Place lamb in bag; massage to coat; then seal and marinate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours. Remove lamb from fridge 1 hour prior to cooking; to ensure even cooking. Wrap bones in foil (optional): Wrap each bone with a small piece of foil. This keeps the bones white and looks prettier. Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Sear: Heat 1 tbsp oil in a cast iron skillet (or other oven-proof; heavy-based skillet) over high heat. Sear one lamb rack on all sides until golden brown; including the ends. Remove and repeat with other lamb rack. Roast: Place both racks in the skillet and roast for 15 minutes; or until the internal temperature is 57°C/135°F (for medium-rare). Remove pan from oven. Baste: Add butter; smashed garlic and rosemary to pan. The residual heat of the pan will melt the butter. Spoon the butter over the lamb continuously for 30 seconds. Rest: Remove lamb from skillet and place on a rack set over a tray. Pour butter remaining in the skillet over lamb. Cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 minutes. Carve and serve! Cut lamb into individual cutlets or several cutlets per slice. Serve with Salsa Verde! Sides: Pictured in post with a Spring Salad and individual Mini Potato Gratin Stacks.
https://www.recipetineats.com/salsa-verde/, Blitz – Place all ingredients in a tall container and blitz into a fine puree (or to the texture you prefer) using a stick blender. You could also use a small food processor. Serving: See in post for extensive list. Serve with steaks; chops or roasted lamb; beef; pork; chicken and seafood (especially great with fish!). It's also excellent with legumes; cooked vegetables and even eggs. You can also use it in the same ways as a tapenade or pesto: Spread on crostini; use in sandwiches; dress salads with it; toss with pasta! 
https://www.recipetineats.com/nutella-cheesecake-no-bake/, Prepare pan: Flip the base of a 20cm / 8" springform pan upside down – this makes it easier to remove the finished cheesecake without the lip in the way. Butter pan base; then press on a square sheet of baking paper. Clip the pan sides onto the base; letting the excess paper overhang. Butter and line the pan sides with more baking paper. Blitz cookies: Roughly break up Oreos with hands and place in food processor. Blitz until they become fine crumbs. Add melted butter; then blitz again until combined.  Press into pan: Transfer crumbs into prepared pan; pressing evenly and firmly on to the base (I use the underside of a straight-sided; flat-bottomed cup measure to do this). Bloom gelatine: Place water in a small bowl then sprinkle the gelatine powder across the surface. Stir to partly dissolve. Set aside 5 minutes. It will turn thick; this process is called blooming. Microwave the gelatine for 15 seconds to turn it into liquid; stir; then let it stand for 5 minutes to cool. Cream cheese and Nutella mixture: Beat cream cheese; Nutella and icing sugar until smooth. Add the cooled gelatine liquid and beat another 30 seconds. Whip cream: In a separate bowl; whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Fold in cream: Add one third of the whipped cream to the Nutella mixture and gently fold until just combined. Fold in another third of the cream the same way. Then fold in the remaining cream. Transfer to cake pan: Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and place back in the fridge for at least 1 hour to set. Nutella ganache: Place cream; Nutella and chocolate chips into a heatproof bowl. Microwave in two 30-second bursts; stirring in between; until smooth.  Pour ganache onto cheesecake: Allow ganache to cool for 5 minutes; then pour over the set cheesecake base. Tilt pan to spread it over the surface evenly. Refrigerate cheesecake at least 3 hours before sprinkling with hazelnuts (otherwise they sink into the cake!) Decorate: Sprinkle over hazelnuts. Pipe dollops of whipped cream around the edge; then drizzle with warm Nutella. Slice greedy-sized wedges and devour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/fluffy-egg-white-omelette/, Pre-heat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). First; separate eggs and place whites in a bowl. Reserve yolks for another use. Cook asparagus and prosciutto: Heat olive oil in a 20cm/8" oven-proof; non-stick pan over medium heat. Add asparagus and cook until tender. When almost done; add prosciutto and stir for 30 seconds – just enough to warm through but not crisp. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Melt butter: Add butter into the same skillet and place over low heat. The butter should melt and be bubbling gently (ie. hot; but not smoking) when the egg whites are ready to pour in. (Note 3) Whisk whites until it's just opaque; fluffy and creamy.  Do not take it to "stiff peaks". It should be a consistency so you can draw a figure 8 on the surface and it stays there without sinking. You do not want to be able to do "elf hats" (see in post for photo); that's too stiff. (Whisking time for me: 90 seconds by hand; 30 seconds on Speed 4 electric beater). Add chives; salt and pepper. Whisk a few times just to mix through. Immediately pour egg whites into hot skillet; spread with a spatula to cover surface. Stir for 10 to 12 seconds until the whites start to set on the base. Remove from stove; then lightly tap the pan 5 times on the stove grates or a heat mat to remove bubbles from the base. Sprinkle asparagus; prosciutto and pecorino on half the omelette (the half opposite the handle). Transfer to oven for 2 minutes. Remove from oven. Run rubber spatula around edges and then under the side without the filling; carefully fold omelette in half to cover the filling. Press the omelette's rounded edge against the side of the pan for 30 seconds to seal the edge. Turn out onto plate: Hold a plate at a 45 degree angle. Then flip the omelette out onto the plate so it lands upside down; ie. pan-contact face up (see video for demo). Garnish with chives. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-butter-salmon-recipe/, Season salmon: Take salmon out of fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Sear salmon 3 mins: Heat oil in large non stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon; presentation side (ie. curved side) down; and cook for 3 minutes until golden. Turn; cook 1 min; then add butter: Turn salmon and cook the other side for 1 minute. THEN put the butter in.  Baste 1 1/2 minutes: Once butter is melted and foaming; add garlic and immediately start spooning the bubbling butter continuously over the salmon for 1 1/2 minutes. To do this; tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools on one side. Use a large spoon to scoop the butter up and spoon it over the salmon. Remove salmon from stove: Check Internal temperature of salmon. It should be 50°C/122°F for medium-rare (optimum juiciness pull temp). Remove salmon to a plate. Rest for 3 minutes – it will rise to 53°C/127°F.  (See Note 2 for internal temperatures) Add lemon juice to butter: Put pan back on unlit stove to keep butter hot. Add lemon juice. Serve: Place salmon on serving plates. Spoon over butter (be judicious; it's rich!); garnish with a sprinkle of parsley. Pictured in the post with Cauliflower Mash and leafy greens with French Vinaigrette.
https://www.recipetineats.com/spanakopita-greek-spinach-pie/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Line a tray with baking paper / parchment paper. Sweat spinach: Place spinach in a large colander or bowl. Sprinkle with salt; toss through. Leave for 10 minutes to sweat. Wring out water: Place a handful of spinach in a tea towel; then wring out tightly to remove excess water. Filling: Place spinach in a bowl with remaining Filling ingredients. Mix well to combine. Trim filo: Cut 16 sheets of filo pastry into 32 x 25cm / 13 x 10" (pictured) or 26cm / 10.5" square. 8 base layers: Layer 8 sheets of filo pastry on the tray; brushing each layer with melted butter. Filling: Spread filling on filo pastry. Smooth surface and leave a 2.5cm / 1" border. 8 Filo topping layers (Note 4): Cover spinach with a sheet of filo pastry. Brush with butter; sprinkle with Kefalotyri. Repeat for Sheets #2 to #5. Then cover with filo sheets #6 to #8; brushing with butter in between; but do NOT sprinkle with cheese (neater finish). Seal: Press edges down to seal. Crimp and trim if desired (see process steps in post or video) or just leave the edges flat on the tray. Sesame seeds: Brush the top with butter; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake: Bake 25 minutes; or until golden brown on the surface. Serve! Serve immediately! It is at its absolute prime fresh out of the oven; though still good as long as its hot (~15 min or so). The base does lose crispiness as it cools.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mushroom-gravy/, Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; then add butter and let it melt. Cook half mushrooms: Add half the mushrooms and cook for 2 mins. Add half the salt and pepper; then continue to cook for another 2 mins until most mushrooms are becoming golden. Then add half the garlic and cook until mushrooms are fully golden; and remove to a plate. Cook remaining mushrooms: Melt remaining butter; then cook remaining mushrooms per above (adding salt & pepper partway through; and garlic towards the end). Remove to a plate. Lower heat to medium. In the same skillet; melt the butter. Add flour and stir continuously for 1 1/2 minutes so the roux doesn't burn. Don't worry if the mixture is a bit dry and sandy; it depends how much fat is left from the mushrooms. While stirring; slowly pour in the beef stock. This should avoid lumps in the gravy. If there are lumps; just whisk vigorously to dissolve them. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes; or until it thickens to a thin-syrup consistency. Stir every now and then at first; then more regularly as the gravy thickens so it doesn't burn on the base of the skillet. Stir in cooked mushrooms; cook for a further 1 minute. Taste and add more salt if needed (if using unsalted homemade stock; you will need more). Pour into a gravy jug and serve with everything! It's particularly great and very Aussie poured over schnitzel with a side of rosti or chips! Otherwise serve with steak; simple pan-seared chops or chicken; sprinkled with salt and pepper before cooking.
https://www.recipetineats.com/korean-kimchi-fried-rice/, Strain kimchi juice – Place kimchi in a sieve set over a bowl. Press firmly to extract as much juice as you can. We need juice for the sauce; and to reduce the wetness of the kimchi so it doesn't make the rice soggy. Measure kimchi juice – Measure out 3 tablespoons of the kimchi juice and set aside. (Note 3 if you're short). Cook enoki mushrooms – Heat 1 tsp sesame oil in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add enoki mushrooms; about 1/2 tsp garlic; plus a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes until just-wilted; then remove to a plate. Garlic and gochujang – Return pan to the stove. Add oil. Add garlic and cook for 20 seconds until it's lightly golden. Add gochujang and cook for 30 seconds until it dries out a bit – just move it around in a lump; breaking it up a bit as you can. Cook kimchi – Add kimchi and cook for 1 minute; just to heat it through (kimchi doesn't need to be cooked) and drive off any excess moisture. Add rice and kimchi juice – Add rice and kimchi juice; toss well for 1 1/2 minutes until the rice is fully stained red. Toss well to ensure the gochujang mixed with the kimchi disperses throughout the rice. Enoki mushrooms and 1 tsp sesame oil – Add the enoki mushrooms and remaining 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. Toss through rice. Serve; topped with garnishes of choice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pineapple-upside-down-cake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Dry fruits: Line a tray with paper towels or a tea towel; then place pineapple and cherries on. Pat dry with paper towels. Butter: Pour melted butter into a 23cm/9" cake pan at least 5cm/2" deep. (Not springform; as they'll leak.) Brush butter up the sides. Brown sugar: Sprinkle sugar over the base; roughly spreading it out (use the brush). Arrange pineapple: Place one pineapple ring in the centre; then surround with either halved pineapple rings (as pictured); or whole ones. Decorate with cherries as desired. Most people just put them in the middle of the pineapple rings. Press cherries and pineapples down firmly so they are in direct contact with the base of the cake pan – so you get vibrant red and yellow colour pops at the end; not tarnished by caramel. (Note 5) Flour Mixture: Whisk flour; baking powder; baking soda and salt in a bowl. Milk Mixture: Whisk milk; sour cream; pineapple juice and vanilla in a 2nd bowl. Cream butter and sugar: In a third (final!) bowl; beat the butter and sugar for 2 minutes on speed 7 (handheld mixer) until fluffy. Eggs: Add eggs one at a time; beating for 20 seconds in between. Add Flour Mixture then Milk Mixture; alternating: Add 1/3 of the Flour Mixture; then mix in using a rubber spatula. Add 1/2 the Milk Mixture; mix in. Add half the remaining Flour Mixture; mix. Add all the remaining Milk Mixture; mix. Then mix in the last of the Flour Mixture. Stir in the leftover pineapple pieces. Fill pan: Spread batter over pineapple layer; smooth and level the surface. Bake: Bake for 30 minutes. Remove; loosely cover with foil; then bake for a further 15 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool 20 minutes: Remove cake from oven and leave inside pan to cool for 20 minutes. Flip! Run a butter knife around the inner edge of the cake pan. Put a plate or serving platter over the cake; then flip. Tap base / shake pan gently then lift slowly. Voila! Cool completely before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/celeriac-soup/, Spice and herb sachet: Bundle the bay leaf; thyme; black peppercorns and coriander seeds loosely in a small piece of cheesecloth to create a sachet. Tie with cooking twine to secure. Cook onion and leek: Melt butter in large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion; leek; celery and garlic. Cook for 10 minutes until onion is soft but not golden. Don't rush this part – this creates an important flavour base so we can make this soup using water not stock. Cook celeriac and potato: Add celeriac and potato. Cook for 10 minutes; stirring regularly; until the outside of the celeriac and potato starts to soften. Be careful to not colour the celeriac – we're going for a white soup here! Simmer 25 minutes: Add salt; pepper; Spice and Herb Sachet; and water. Bring to a boil; then turn down to a simmer. Simmer for 25 minutes (no lid) until celeriac is very soft. Cream: Add cream; simmer for another 3 minutes. Blitz: Remove Sachet; then blitz until fully smooth using your method of choice: Stick blender (~ 3 mins); or cool slightly and do in a blender in batches (Note 5) Adjust seasoning: Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serving: Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with croutons and chives; drizzle with olive oil. Serve with crusty bread for dunking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-barbacoa/, Cut beef: Cut large cheeks in half so you have around 12 – 15 pieces cheeks. If using chuck; cut into 12 or so pieces. Season: Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brown beef: Heat oil in a large pot or skillet over high heat. Sear beef in batches; browning aggressively all over. Place beef in slow cooker. Blitz sauce: Place Barbacoa Sauce ingredients in a blender; food processor or similar (I use a Nutribullet). Blend until smooth – it shouldn't take long. Slow cooker (see Note 4 for alt. cooking methods): Pour sauce over cheeks in slow cooker. Add bay leaves. Arrange cheeks so they are submerged as much as possible. Don't worry; they will release juice as they cook and raise the liquid level. Slow-cook for 8 hours on low. The beef should be effortless to shred when done. Shred: Remove cheeks from slow cooker into a pan. Shred using 2 forks. Sauce: Pour over 3 or 4 ladles of the sauce; then toss. Serve: Use in tacos with taco fixings of choice! Pictured with Mexican Red Rice; Pickled Red Cabbage for Tacos (in this Fish Tacos recipe) and Lime Crema (Note 5).
https://www.recipetineats.com/focaccia-recipe/, Make mashed potato: Peel potato; cut into 2.5cm / 1" chunks. Boil until fully tender (around 10 – 15 mins; check centre with skewer). Drain and mash very well with a potato ricer or masher until smooth and lump-free. Set aside to cool; and measure out required quantity. Mix Dry: Place flour; salt; sugar and yeast in a large bowl and mix well with a firm rubber spatula. Add Wet: Make a well in the centre; then add olive oil and warm water. Mix with spatula until you can no longer see flour. Dough should be sticky – too sticky to knead by hand. Add Potato: Add mashed potato. Using a folding motion; start mixing it through using the spatula. Then start smearing it along the walls of the bowl. Once potato is evenly incorporated; shape roughly into a ball in the bowl. Rise 1: Cover bowl with cling wrap; then put in a warm place (25°C/77°F) for 30 minutes until it increases in volume by 50% or up to double in size. (Note 6) Fold dough: Get another large bowl; drizzle with 2 teaspoons of olive oil then use your hands to smear it around the bowl. Scrape dough in; then fold the edges of the dough into the centre six times. Shape into ball; cover with cling wrap. Rise 2: Put the bowl in a warm place (25°C/77°F) for 30 minutes until it increases in volume by 50% or up to double in size. Prepare pan (see Note 7 for pan types info): Meanwhile; prepare the pan. Use a 26.5 x 20 x 5 cm / 10.5 x 8 x 2” metal non-stick pan; or a 9”/23cm round cake pan; preferably not springform. Pour in 2 tablespoons of olive oil; then smear it all across the base and along the walls. Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 220°C / 430°F (200°C fan); and set a rack on middle shelf. Allow enough time to ensure oven has been preheated for at least 15 mins for best results. Put dough in pan: Scrape dough into prepared pan. Stretch and pull to fill the base as best you can (itʼs an elastic dough so a bit stubborn!); and get the surface roughly level. Itʼs ok if itʼs bumpy; it will smooth out later. Rise 3: Cover pan with cling wrap; then put in a warm place for 40 minutes until the dough expands and fills the pan; and the heigh rises by around 25 – 30%. Smear surface with oil: Drizzle the surface with 2 teaspoons of olive oil; and smear/rub it over lightly with your hands. Poke! Using both your hands like claws; push your fingers deep into the dough;  right to the base of the pan to create the signature dimples. Do this around half a dozen times across dough surface. This will somewhat deflate the dough and is OK. (Note 8) Toppings: Top with toppings of choice – see below. Finishing olive oil & salt flakes: Drizzle the surface with 2 tablespoons of olive oil so it runs into the dimples. Then sprinkle with sea salt flakes. Bake for 25 – 30 minutes until the top is deep golden and lightly crisp; while the sides are fried and crusty. Cool: Turn out onto a cooling rack. Let is rest for at least 10 minutes before cutting to serve. It is ridiculously good served freshly made! Optional: Finishing with a final flourish of extra virgin olive oil across the surface certainly doesnʼt go astray! Also some olive oil for dipping is always welcome. 🙂 Confit Garlic & Rosemary: Place garlic and oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil becomes hot; turn down to low and leave for 10 minutes. The garlic should not sizzle; it just poaches gently in hot oil. Strain; cool; then press onto surface of focaccia. Sprinkle with rosemary. Proceed with recipe. Cherry tomato: Squish each tomato while holding near focaccia surface. Press onto surface; pushing into the dough. Sprinkle with oregano. Proceed with recipe. Olives: Press onto surface of focaccia; pushing into the dough. Sprinkle with oregano. Proceed with recipe.
https://www.recipetineats.com/my-favourite-quinoa-salad/, Toast for extra flavour: Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180° fan) Spread quinoa on a tray. Bake 15 minutes; stirring halfway; until it's lightly browned and smells nutty. Rinse: Transfer to fine mesh sieve or strainer. Rinse under running water for 10 seconds; shake off excess water well. Cook: Scrape into a medium saucepan. Add water; place lid on. Bring to simmer on medium heat; then lower stove to low and simmer for 15 minutes (or until all water is absorbed; tilt pot to check). Rest: Remove from stove (lid still on) and rest for 10 minutes. Fluff & cool: Remove lid; fluff quinoa with a fork and allow to fully cool before using. (Spread on a tray if you want to speed things up). Dressing: Place ingredients in a jar and shake well. Toss salad! Place quinoa in a large bowl. Add all salad ingredients. Pour over dressing; toss very well. Garnish: Either transfer to a large serving platter or individual bowls. Sprinkle generously with crushed Wasabi Peas and sesame seeds. Devour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/asian-glazed-baked-barramundi-recipe/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Line a tray with parchment/baking paper. Place shelf in middle of oven. Cornflour slurry: Mix water and cornflour in a small bowl. Make glaze: Place remaining glaze ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add cornflour slurry then stir well. Cook it for a further 2 minutes until it thickens into a thick paste – thick enough so it stays on the fish when brushed on. See photo in post or video. If it is just a thick syrup; it will slide off the fish. Brush glaze on Fish: Place fish fillets on tray. Dab/brush paste on on the top and sides. Bake then broil/grill: Bake fish for 15 minutes. Then flick to broiler/grill on high; and cook for 3 minutes to caramelise the surface. Target an internal temperature of 55°C/131°F for medium; which is just cooked but not raw at all. Fish temperature will continue to rise to 58°C/136.5°F during resting. Garnish: Remove from oven; transfer to serving plates and rest for 5 minutes. Garnish with green onion; chillies and sesame seeds; as desired. Pictured in post with a side of Coconut Rice and cucumber with Asian Sesame Dressing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/samosa-recipe/, Boil potato until soft: Peel then cut potatoes in half. Place in a pot of cold water; bring to boil then cook until very soft; ~10 minutes. Mash roughly: Remove the potatoes onto a plate and roughly mash with a fork; leaving some large chunks (we want some textural interest). Cook spice seeds: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds; mustard seeds & coriander seeds. Stir the spices for about 30 seconds or until fragrant –  don't let them burn! Add the ginger; chilli; peas and continue to stir a further minute or so until the chilli is soft. Add remaining spices: Add the garam masala; amchur; asafoetida; cumin powder; turmeric and salt. Cook a further 30 seconds. Add potato and gently stir to coat in spices for about 1 minute. Cool: Remove from the stove; stir in chopped coriander leaves. Spread potato mixture out on a plate and let it cool completely before using. Mix dry ingredients: Place the flour; salt and ajwain seeds into a bowl and stir to combine. Rub ghee into flour: Add the ghee or oil and mix with your fingertips until the dough resembles breadcrumbs. (This step is key to making flaky samosa pastry.) Form a ball: Add the water and mix with the flour until you form a ball of dough. It should be pliable and soft; but not so sticky it sticks to your hands;. Rest 30 minutes: Cover the dough in the bowl with glad wrap and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Cut into 6: Cut the dough into 6 equal portions; then roll each into a ball. Keep the balls on a plate covered with cling wrap so they don't dry out. Place between paper: Place one ball on a sheet of parchment/baking paper. Press down to flatten; then cover with another sheet of paper. Do not flour the work surface – it will dry the pastry out. Roll out: Roll the dough into a disc about 2mm / 1/10" thick (~16cm /6.5” diameter). Cut in half: Cut through the centre to create two semicircles (2 samosas per disc). Make cone: Brush the straight side with water; then fold straight edge to join itself and form a cone. Overlap the edges by about 1 cm / 2/5" then press edges to seal. Fill with potato: Make an "O" with your forefinger and thumb; then hold the cone in the "O". Fill with about 2 tbsp of Potato Mixture; lightly pressing in. Seal: Brush the open pastry edge with water; then press together so your Samosa is fully sealed. Place sealed edge down on work surface and press down to fold. Trim off excess pastry; fold in corners. Pinch the top corner to make it pointy. Repeat with remaining Samosas – you should make 12 in total. Heat oil to medium: In a deep pan or pot; heat 5cm / 2" oil to 160°C/320°F). (Note 7) Fry 1: Carefully drop 3 – 4 samosas in the oil and cook for 3 minutes; moving them around occasionally (if they touch the base of the pot for too long; they get brown spots). Drain and repeat: Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining samosas. Increase oil heat: Increase the oil temperature up to 190°C/375°F. Fry 2: Carefully place 3 – 4 samosas at the time into the oil; and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until they are deep golden. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining Samosas. Serve hot with Tamarind Sauce or a Mint Raita (see separate recipe card below this one) Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the ginger; chilli; cumin; asafoetida and garam masala; stir and cook gently for 1 minute to release the flavours and toast the spices. Add the water; tamarind paste and brown sugar and stir until the sugar has completely dissolved. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes until the sauce turns thick and syrupy – it should be the consistency of sweet soy/ketchup manis (ie. like very runny honey). Taste and adjust the tamarind to suit. Cool the sauce before using. The sauce will thicken as it cools. Serve with hot Samosas.
https://www.recipetineats.com/naan-recipe/, Bloom yeast: Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap; leave for 10 minutes until foamy. Egg and milk: Whisk milk and egg together. Flour: Sift flour and salt into a separate bowl. Add wet ingredients: Make a well in the flour; add yeast mixture; and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. Once the flour is mostly incorporated; switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required. Proof 1: Cover the bowl with cling-wrap; then leave in a warm place for 1 – 1.5 hrs until it doubles in size. (Note 7) Cut into 6 pieces: Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces; then shape into balls into spheres with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under (see video). Proof 2: Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour; cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%. Roll out: Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface; flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16" thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5" wide). Heat skillet: Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 1/2 tsp oil on a paper towl (unless already well seasoned). Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke. (Note 8 for other pans) Cook naan: Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred – the surface should get bubbly. Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown. Cook remaining naan: Remove; set aside; and repeat with remaining naan; taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot. Finishing: Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee (or garlic butter; Note 5). Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot! Roll out a naan per above directions. Brush with plain butter or garlic butter. (Note 5) Place a mound of cheese in the middle – about 1/4 cup; lightly-packed. Bundle it up; money bag-style; then twist to seal. Turn upside down so the smooth side is up. Roll out to 6-7mm / 1/4" thick rounds. Heat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet preheated over high heat; but not until the skillet is smoking. Cook naan for around 1 1/2 minutes on the first side until golden – it will puff up! Turn and cook the other side for around 45 seconds.

https://www.recipetineats.com/palak-paneer-indian-spinach-curry-with-cheese/, Saute onion & spices: Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion; fenugreek; cumin; coriander; salt and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes until onion is softened but not golden. Add garlic and ginger; cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato and chilli; cook for 3 minutes on a medium heat. Add spinach: Add about 1/3 of the spinach – or as much as you can handle in the pot (!) – and stir until wilted. Then add more spinach along with the water; cook again until wilted. Repeat until all the spinach is wilted. Cook 10 minutes: Cook; stirring every now and then; for 10 minutes still on a medium heat. Cream & lemon: Add the cream and lemon juice. Cook; stirring gently; for 3 minutes. Puree half spinach: Remove half the spinach into a tall container and blend it to a puree using a stick blender. Pour pureed spinach back into the pot; and stir to combine. Add Pan Fried Paneer: Gently stir in golden pan-fried paneer (see below). Stir gently to mix through. Serve over basmati rice with fluffy; chewy homemade naan on the side! Cut paneer into 1.25cm / ½" thick slices. Then cut each slice into 2.5cm x 2 x 1.25cm thick pieces / 1 x ⅘" x ½" pieces – approximately! Melt half the ghee or butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Place half the paneer in the pan and cook for 1 – 1 1/2 minutes until light golden – I tend to make it deep golden because colour = more flavour; but traditional is just a hint of gold Turn; then cook the other side until light golden. Remove onto paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining butter and paneer. Use per recipe.
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-make-paneer-fresh-indian-cheese/, Heat the milk in a large saucepan over medium high heat until the top becomes foamy; just as looks like it's about to boil. Turn stove off. Add lemon juice and stir for 1 minute. The milk should begin to curdle. If it doesn’t; turn the stove back on and bring back to a gentle boil until the solids separate. Line strainer or colander: Place over a deep bowl. Line strainer with 2 layers of cheesecloth (Note 1). Strain: Ladle in half of the curdled milk to begin with; then pour the rest in. Leave until all the liquid drains – this might take 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse: Discard liquid (whey) in the bowl. Bundle the paneer up in the cheesecloth (it will still be quite watery at this stage) then rinse bundle briefly under cold tap water. This helps to remove lemon flavour + cool for easier handling. Squeeze out excess water by twisting the cheesecloth and squeezing the bundle; but not so hard that paneer squeezes out through the cloth. Once liquid no longer comes out; stop. The paneer will still be quite soft at this stage. Weigh cheese down with weights: Shape cheese into a disc around 2cm / ¾" thick; still wrapped in cheesecloth. Place in a strainer or colander set over a bowl. Top with a small plate then 2 x 400g/14oz cans (or similar weight). Refrigerate for 4 hours. During this time the paneer will set (become firm) and remaining liquid will drain out. (Note 2) Remove paneer from fridge and carefully unwrap. There will be a dent in the middle; this is normal (it's from the draining). At this stage; the paneer is now ready for use. You can either cut it immediately and use in a recipe (such as Palak Paneer!); or store the whole uncut block for another time and just cut when needed.  Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks; or freeze for 3 months.
https://www.recipetineats.com/carrot-cake-cupcakes/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Line a 12-hole muffin tin with cupcake liners.

https://www.recipetineats.com/bearnaise-sauce/, Place Infused Vinegar ingredients in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Simmer for 2 minutes; then remove from stove and let it stand for 5 minutes to infuse. Strain; pressing to extract as much liquid as possible. You should have around 1 tbsp of liquid. Cool 5 minutes before use. Place butter in a jug and microwave until melted (1 – 1½  minutes on high; but watch it carefully so it doesn't explode!). Stand for 30 seconds until the milky whites settle at the bottom (this is the milk solids) and clarified butter (golden part) sits above it. Pour off 175g / 3/4 cup of the clarified butter; discard the milky whites remaining. Use in this recipe while hot. Alternative: Just melt 175g / 3/4 cup ghee; which is the same thing as clarified butter. Place egg yolks; infused vinegar and salt in a tall; narrow container that the blender stick fits in all the way to the base. Blitz briefly to combine. With the stick blender going on high; slowly drizzle the butter in over about a minute. Important: The butter must still be hot! If it has cooled; reheat until hot. After all the butter is in; blitz for a further 10 seconds; moving the stick up and down. Thickness: Add 1 tablespoon water; then blitz to incorporate. Add more water as needed; 1 teaspoon at a time; until the Bearnaise Sauce is a thick sauce but loose enough to ooze across a steak; coating it thickly. Fresh herbs: Stir in tarragon and chervil. Using: Use immediately; or keep warm until required. I use a thermos – a good one will keep it warm for at least 1 hour. Use warm or at room temperature. See note for storing and reheating.

https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-beef-stock/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Spread bones out across 2 baking trays. Roast for 1 hour; turning at 30 minutes; or until very well browned. Drain and discard excess fat; if any. Place bones into large stock pot (7 litres/7 quarts+ capacity) Place tray on stove; turn onto medium. Add 3/4 cup water. When it comes to a simmer; start scraping the tray. The drippings (fond) on the tray will loosen and dissolve into the liquid. Once most of the drippings are removed from the base; scrape all the liquid into the pot. Repeat with other tray. Add remaining ingredients into the pot. Start with 3 litres of water; then squish the bones etc down to fit snugly in the pot. Add more water if needed; to just cover the bones (ingredients will collapse a bit as stock cooks). The water quantity depends on shape of bone and pot –  my water level came to 5.75 litres/quarts mark on pot. Boil then simmer: Bring to a boil on medium high; then turn down to low so it's simmering ever so gently; with only a small bubble bursting every now and then.  Remove surface scum: Scoop off any surface scum using a ladle and discard. Simmer for 8 hours on very low; no lid. Liquid level should reduce to around 4 litres/quarts for all – if not; just reduce after straining (Step 3 under Strain & Finish). Other methods: – Stove 3 hours on medium-low (very gentle simmer; with lid cracked)– oven (lid on) for 8 to 10 hours at 120°C/250°F (100°C fan). Water level will only reduce by about 500ml / 0.5 qt. Strain then rapid boil to reduce to 1.5 lt / 1.5 qt. – slow cooker 8 to 10 hours on low. Reduce after straining to 1.5 lt / 1.5 qt. Strain: Fish out most bones. Strain stock with remaining vegetables through a fine mesh colander / strainer set over a large pot or bowl. Leave strainer for a few minutes to let it drip. Cool to room temperature: Set stock pot or bowl in sink filled with cold water. Leave stock to cool for around 1h 15 mins; changing water every 20 mins or so as it gets warm. Measure stock volume: Pour stock into a vessel to measure volume – it should be between around 1.3 – 1.7 litres/quarts. If it's much more; reduce on the stove; otherwise stock flavour will be too weak. Refrigerate stock. When fat has solidified on surface; carefully scrape off with a large spoon and discard. You should have 1.25 – 1.5 L/Qts remaining. Ready! Beef stock is now ready to use! This stock is equivalent in strength to store-bought stock; so it can be used 1:1 in any recipe calling for beef stock. Salt adjustment: Homemade stock is unsalted whereas store-bought stock is salted. Add 1/4 tsp salt for every 1 cup homemade beef stock (250ml) to match the salt level of store-bought low sodium beef stock. To use: Cold stock has a jellied consistency (Note 4). It takes barely a minute to turn liquid on a medium high stove; or microwave. You can also just add it in jelly form straight into dishes; but sometimes you may need to liquify it to measure.
https://www.recipetineats.com/acqua-pazza-italian-poached-fish/, Sauté  fennel and onion: Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add fennel and onion; cook 4 minutes until softened but not golden. Garlic and chilli: Add garlic and chilli; cook for 1 minute until garlic is softened. Tomatoes: Add cherry tomatoes; cook for 4 minutes. Reduce wine: Turn stove up to high; add wine and simmer rapidly for 2 – 3 minutes until reduced by half. Simmer sauce: Add water and salt; and the basil & parsley stems if you kept them. Bring to boil; then lower stove to medium and simmer for 20 – 25 minutes until sauce reduces by about 2/3 (it will thicken from tomatoes breaking down). Cook fish: Sprinkle flesh side of fish with salt; then place on sauce skin side down (it will mostly sit above sauce). Cover with lid (or foil or tray) and cook for 6 minutes or until internal temperature registers 55°C/131°F (for medium; no rare/raw left with optimum juiciness). Remove fish: Remove lid; transfer fish to plate. Add herbs: Remove basil and parsley stems. Stir basil and parsley into sauce. Taste sauce; add more salt if required. Place 2 crostini in a shallow bowl. Spoon over a bit of the chunky sauce; top with fish. Spoon remaining sauce around. Garnish with extra basil and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all types). Brush olive oil on bread; sprinkle with a bit of salt. Flip and repeat. Bake 10 minutes; turning halfway; or until fully crispy. Rub bread lightly on one side with cut face of garlic. Use warm or at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/salted-caramel-stuffed-brownies/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Butter and line a 20cm / 8" square tin with parchment / baking paper. Place the ingredients in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Stir occasionally for the first 1 minute. When it is heated (ie. when you see wisps of steam); whisk constantly (leisurely; not vigorously!) for 7 minutes; ensuring the base doesn't catch (Note 3). It should be a pale golden colour. Remove from stove and whisk for 30 seconds. Place lid on; set aside and keep warm. Melt chocolate & butter: Place chocolate and butter in a bowl. Microwave in three 30 second bursts on high; stirring in between bursts; until melted and smooth. Add sugar; eggs; vanilla: Add the sugar; eggs and vanilla extract to the chocolate mixture and mix well to combine.  Add dry ingredients: Sift in the flour; cocoa powder and salt. Mix until smooth and combined. Reserve some batter: Measure out 1/2 cup of brownie batter and set aside. Pour the remaining batter into the prepared tin. Pour over caramel: Pour the Salted Caramel over the brownie batter; getting as much coverage as you can (as you can't easily spread the caramel once poured). If caramel has cooled and is no longer pourable; reheat it on stove for 1 minute until runny again. Cover with reserved brownie batter: Dollop the reserved 1/2 cup of brownie batter randomly over the Salted Caramel. Use a knife or skewer to make “swirls” – they won't be so visible once baked; it's more about spreading brownie batter over the caramel. Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes (for very gooey brownie; as pictured) to 35 minutes (for very moist but not super-gooey). Cool: Leave to cool in pan for 10 minutes. Use surplus paper overhang to lift out onto a cooling rack. Cool for a further 20 minutes before slicing. Note: Caramel is a bit gooey when still warm but sets firmer once fully cooled; ie. it will cut through neatly.

Sauté garlic: Add garlic and stir for 20 seconds or until light golden. Reduce wine: Add white wine; turn up heat to high. Bring to simmer while stirring base of the pan to dissolve all the golden bits into the sauce. Cook 1 minute or until it most evaporates and the wine-y smell is gone. Thicken cream & stock: Add cream and chicken stock; then simmer on medium heat for 2 – 3 minutes until reduced and slightly thickened. Add parmesan & herbs: Stir through parmesan (this will thicken sauce more); then the herbs. Taste sauce and see if more salt and pepper is needed. Serve: Serve salmon with Creamy Sauce; ensuring there's something on the plate to soak up all that amazing sauce! Mashed Potato rates highly. See above video for list of suggestions (including side salads).
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-butterflied-lamb-leg/, Mix marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag. Add lamb; massage bag well to get the marinade into all the meat cracks and crevices. Seal bag and marinate for 24 hours (3 hours minimum). Remove lamb from the fridge 1 hour prior to cooking (to take fridge chill out for more even cooking). Brush grates with oil then preheat BBQ until very hot. (Takes a good 15 minutes; lid closed; with my basic gas BBQ). Remove lamb from marinade and place on the grill; fat side down. Cook for 12 minutes; then turn and cook the flesh side for 8 minutes; or until the internal temperature in the thickest part registers 57°C / 135°F for medium-rare or desired pull temperature (see Note 3).

Simmer for 15 minutes uncovered on stove on medium-low to cook the beans and reduce the sauce. Stir through lemon juice and zest. The idea here is that some of the veg (butternut; cauliflower) breaks down a bit to slightly thicken the sauce. It also gets thicker left overnight. For a traditional experience; serve over couscous. Otherwise; try white; brown; or basmati rice; or quinoa. Or; serve just as is like a chunky stew. For a low-carb option try cauliflower rice! I like to top mine with a dollop of yogurt; a sprinkle of almonds; coriander/cilantro and a pinch of paprika or cayenne.
https://www.recipetineats.com/couscous/, Heat chicken stock until boiling using whatever method you choose (stove; 3 – 4 minutes in microwave on high). Pour over couscous in a heatproof bowl. Shake to level the couscous; cover with plate (or cling wrap). Leave for 10 minutes; then fluff with fork. Stir through olive oil; lemon juice and salt. Stir through either herbs or fruit & nuts. Or as I do; use it all! Keep warm until ready to use. Ideal served with Tagine; or anything Middle Eastern.
https://www.recipetineats.com/blueberry-cake-with-lemon-frosting/, Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) for 20 minutes before starting the batter. Place one shelf in the middle of the oven and a second beneath it. Cake pans: Grease 3 x 20cm / 8” cake pans with butter and line with parchment / baking paper. (Note 9 more pan sizes) Blueberries: Set aside ~1/3 of the blueberries (for scattering later). Toss the remaining blueberries in flour. Be prepared: Have all batter ingredients measured out and ready to add in. New to baking? Read 'Tips for Success' above recipe card. Combine dry ingredients: Whisk flour; baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk eggs: Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment; or hand beater. Add sugar; then beat: With the beater still going; pour the sugar in over 45 seconds. Then beat for 7 minutes on speed 8; or until tripled in volume and white. Gently add flour: Scatter 1/3 flour across surface of whipped eggs; then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Add half remaining flour; mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 – 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can’t see flour; stop straight away. Whisk wet ingredients: Put sour cream; hot butter; oil; vanilla and lemon zest into the now-empty flour bowl. Whisk well until smooth. 'Temper' sour cream mix: Add about 1 1/2 cups of the egg mixture into the sour cream bowl (2 big scoops; no need to be accurate). Whisk well until smooth. Slowly combine sour cream mix and egg mix: Turn beater back on Speed 1 then scrape the sour cream mixture into the egg mixture over 15 seconds; then turn beater off. Scrape and final mix: Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds. The batter should be thick but soft; not runny and thin. Blueberries: Quickly but gently fold in flour coated blueberries. Divide batter between cake pans; smooth the surface. Scatter over reserved blueberries. Bake 25 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean. (If you cannot fit all pans on one shelf; put 2 pans in the middle shelf and 1 pan underneath. Take the top pans out at 25 minutes; move the lower pan to middle shelf and bake for a further 3 minutes)  Once out of oven; cool in cake pans for 15 minutes; then gently turn out onto cooling racks upside down. Peel off baking paper and cool upside down – any slight dome will flatten perfectly (for neat layers). Frost upside down layers with Cream Cheese Frosting! Decorate with extra blueberries; lemon slices and edible flowers; if desired. Beat butter with whisk attachment in stand mixer for 2 minutes until fluffy and creamy; and it becomes a paler colour. Add cream cheese; then beat for 30 seconds just until smooth. Add icing sugar / powdered sugar; then gently mix on speed 1 (to avoid an icing powder storm). If you do get a powder storm; cover with tea towel; then once mostly incorporated; beat on high for a full 2 minutes on Speed 7. Add vanilla and lemon juice; then beat for a further 30 seconds. Use immediately. (Note 11 re: frosting too sloppy)
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-beer-battered-fish/, Dry & cut fish: Pat fish dry using paper towels or a tea towel. Cut into 7 x 3cm / 3 x 1¼"  batons; or larger fillets if you prefer. If you have very thick fillets; cut in half horizontally (Note 1) Dusting bowl: Place ¼ cup rice flour in a shallow bowl. Heat oil: Heat 6cm / 2" – 3" oil in a large heavy based pot over medium high heat to 190°C/375°F. Salt & dust:  While oil is heating; sprinkle 3 or 4 pieces of fish with a pinch of salt; then coat in rice flour and shake off excess. You can leave them like this for up to 10 minutes. Cold batter: Just before cooking; whisk together the flour; rice flour; baking powder and salt. Add very cold beer into the batter and whisk just until incorporated evenly into the flour. Do not over-mix; do not worry about flour lumps (Note 4). It should be a fairly thin batter but fully coat the back of a spoon. If too thick; add beer 1 tsp at a time.  Dredge fish: Dunk a piece of fish in the batter; the let the excess drip off very briefly.  Fry 3 minutes: Carefully lower into oil; dropping it in away from you; one piece at a time. Don't crowd the pot; fry in batches. Fry for 3 minutes; flipping after about 2 minutes; until deep golden. Drain: Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining fish. Serve hot! However it will stay crisp for 15 – 20 minutes. (Note 5 for larger batch cooking).  Serve with Tartare Sauce; lemon wedges and a leafy green salad on the side dressed with a classic vinaigrette. Serve with Crispy French Fries or oven baked wedges!
https://www.recipetineats.com/best-ever-authentic-guacamole/, Place the onion; jalapeño; salt and half the coriander on a cutting board and use a fork to mash until juicy. OR do this in a mortar and pestle – grind into a paste. Scrape into a bowl; add avocado and remaining coriander; and mash to desired consistency. Do a taste test then adjust to your taste: salt; lime juice for sour; more chilli for spiciness. If using tomatoes; stir through. Serve with corn chips!
https://www.recipetineats.com/lobster-recipes-cooked-lobster-crayfish/, If lobster was frozen; thaw lobster overnight in a bowl or tray (with sides to catch liquid). Drain well before use. Cut between head and tail: Insert a small knife at a 45 degree angle into the gap between the tail and head. Cut along the top and sides through to the middle – no need to do underneath. Separate head from tail: Twist the tail to separate it from the head. It will pull out meat from the head as well.  Clean: Scrape or trim off any yellow of black residue on the end that came out of the head. Cut underside: Cut down both sides of the soft shell on the underside of the tail. Then peel it back like a can of sardines to reveal the lobster flesh. Remove flesh: Carefully remove the flesh – it should come off the shell cleanly. Remove poop vein – if you see a poop vein (black "string" down the back of the lobster tail meat); then carefully pull it out. If you stretch the meat out straight; you should be able to pull it out in one go. Otherwise; pick it out when you slice it. (Sometimes poop vein is thick; sometimes barely there!) Residual meat in head: There will be some residual meat in the head that can be used. The yellow "mustard" (called tomalley) has very intense lobstar flavour but is an acquired taste… I do not eat it! How to serve: Lobster tail meat can be served whole; sliced into thick or thin pieces or diced; depending on use. I do not recommend shredded as it loses juiciness. Make Sauce per the Dipping Sauces recipe. Serve alongside lobster for dipping. Either cut the lobster into bite size pieces; or serve whole for people to cut themselves. Plate it up individually or on a share platter. Make the Prawn Cocktail recipe but substitute prawn for lobster cut into small bite size pieces. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Once foamy; add garlic and cook until light golden. Remove from stove; add lemon juice and parsley.  Serving: Pour into serving bowl and serve alongside lobster. Garnish with parsley leaves and lemon wedges.   Eating: Let people either dip in bite size pieces or drizzle over lobster; plated up indivudually or on a share style plate. Mop plate clean with crusty bread! Make the sauce per the Lemon Browned Butter Sauce recipe.  Slice the lobster into bite size pieces. Pile onto plate or arrange on indivudual plates. Sprinkle with salt (necessary as browned butter is unsalted). Serving: Drizzle with some browned butter; then serve more on the side. Garnish with parsley leaves and lemon wedges.  Eating: To eat; dip or drizzle lobster with more browned butter. Mop plate clean with crusty bread! Blitz ingredients in a Nutribullet or small food processor until it becomes a paste. It should be smooth but a bit of courseness for texture ie don't blend into a smoothie. Slice lobster into bite size pieces. Arrange on indvidual plates or share plate. Drizzle little dollops of salsa verde over lobster – don't go overboard; the flavour is quite strong! Garnish with lemon wedges & parlsey leaves; serve. Place lobster in a bowl. Add mayonnaise; lemon; chives; celery; green onions; salt and pepper. Gently toss to coat.  Split then generously butter buns or rolls. Stuff generously! Makes 2 mini brioche buns or 3 round rolls.
https://www.recipetineats.com/potatoes-au-gratin/, Cream Mixture: Place butter; cream and garlic in a jug. Mix until combined. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (both fan and standard ovens). Slice potatoes: Peel the potatoes and slice them 1/8"/3 mm thick. Or use a slicer! Layer 1: Spread 1/3 of the potatoes in a baking dish (Note 3); then pour over 1/3 of the Cream Mixture; scatter with 1/3 of the salt; pepper and thyme. Sprinkle with 3/4 cups cheese. Layers 2 & 3: Repeat for the 2nd and third layer; but do not finish with cheese on the top layer (will add later). Cover & bake: Cover with lid or foil; and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes or until the potatoes in the middle are soft (use knife to test); it might take 1 1/2 hours. (Note 5) Top with cheese; bake again: Remove foil; top with cheese. Bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes until golden and bubbly. Stand 5 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-cake-moist-easy-fruit-cake/, Place dried fruit and juice/brandy in a large microwavable container. Microwave 1 1/2 minutes on high or until hot. Stir to coat all fruit in liquid. Cover then set aside for 1 hour (to plump up/soak and cool). Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (140°C fan). Grease and line a 21 – 22 cm / 8 – 9" round cake pan with baking paper (parchment paper) (7 cm / 2.75" tall). Using an electric beater; beat butter and sugar until smooth and creamy (about 1 minute on speed 5). Add oil and molasses; beat until combined. Add salt; spices and baking powder – beat until incorporated. Add eggs; one at a time; beating until just incorporated Stir in the flour. When mostly incorporated; stir in the fruit mix (including all the extra liquid in bowl) and walnuts (if using). Pour into cake pan; cover with foil and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Remove the foil then bake for another 30 to 45 minutes; or until a skewer inserted into middle comes out clean with no batter on it (check first at 30 minutes). Remove from oven and cool for 20 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Cool completely before serving. Cake is moist and so full flavoured; it can be eaten plain. But see below for decorating and serving ideas (traditionally served with pouring custard). Cutting: Either cut into thin wedges; or cut cake into thin strips (2cm / 0.75" or so); then cut those strips into serving size pieces. Traditional White Christmas Cake (pictured in post) – Marzipan and fondant; see Decorating Note. Simple – pile top with fresh cherries or other fruit; dust with icing sugar (powdered sugar). Wrap a ribbon around the cake for extra touch! Drippy white glaze  – use the glaze in this Lemon Cake recipe; but leave out the lemon juice (ie make a plain sweet white glaze). Flip cake upside down for flat surface then glaze per that recipe. Serving – serve with custard for a traditional experience! Either homemade custard or store bought pouring custard (jazz it up by mixing in vanilla seed paste!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-popcorn-candy/, Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add a few pieces of popcorn and wait until it pops; then quickly remove. Add remaining popcorn; elevate off stove to shake and spread corn out evenly. Cover with a lid. Once the popcorn starts popping in earnest; shake the pot gently once. Remove from heat when the popping almost stops (when you can count to 3 between pops) and transfer to a (very!) large bowl. You need 10 cups of popcorn. Preheat oven to 110°C/230°F. Melt butter in a saucepaan over medium heat. Add sugar; corn syrup (or glucose) and salt. Stir until just combined. When it starts to bubble; simmer for 4 minutes – DO NOT STIR! Remove from heat then quickly whisk in Christmas Spices; vanilla and baking soda. Whisk vigorously for 10 seconds; then when you stop whisking; the caramel will foam and increase in volume. Quickly pour straight over popcorn; toss to coat. Sprinkle over the almonds; and toss again until caramel cools and starts to harden. Spread popcorn across 2 baking trays. Bake for 45 minutes; tossing every 10 minutes or so. Caramel will remelt for the first 2-3 tosses – tossing further coats popcorn more evenly with caramel. (If using glucose instead of corn syrup; bake further 15 minutes). Remove from oven; leave to cool. Gently break into pieces then transfer to airtight container for storage. Stays crisp 2 – 3 weeks!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pork-shoulder-roast-with-crispy-crackling/, Dry skin: Pat the skin dry with paper towels. If time permits; leave in the fridge uncovered overnight (even 1 hr helps). If not; pat extra well.  Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Season flesh: Sprinkle pork flesh with 1 1/2 tsp salt; all the pepper and all fennel seeds and 1 tbsp olive oil. Rub into flesh; right into all the crevices and cracks. Salt skin: Flip pork; drizzle skin with 1 tsp oil; then rub all over with fingers. Sprinkle all over with remaining 1 1/2 tsp salt; taking care to get even coverage. Un-salted patches will not become bubbly crackling; it will be a hard flat sheet. Garlic & onion bed: Place halved garlic bulbs and onion in roasting pan. Place pork skin side up on top of them. Wine: Carefully pour wine into the pan; being sure not to wet the skin. Transfer to oven. Lower oven: Immediately turn oven down to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan). Slow roast: Roast for 2 1/2 hours.  Level at 1 1/2 hours: Check pork after 1 1/2 hours to see if the pork is warped and the skin's overall surface is significantly unlevelled. If so; adjust to make the skin surface as level as possible using balls of foil and moving large dislodged pork pieces to the side (key tip for crispy crackling; Note 3). Then return to oven for the remaining 1 hour. Check pan & salt on skin:  If pan is drying out; add some water. If there are bald patches on the skin without salt (eg it fell off); spray lightly with oil spray (or brush lightly with oil) then sprinkle with salt. (Remember; salt = bubbly skin!) Increase heat: Turn oven up to 250°C/485°F (all oven types); or as high as it will go if your oven won't go this high. Make skin crisp: Return pork to oven for 30 minutes; rotating pan as needed; until skin is crisp and bubbly all over. If needed; use foil patches; secured with water soaked toothpicks; to cover parts that are done and keep crisping up remaining patches. Rest: Transfer pork to serving platter; tent loosely with foil (don't worry; crackling stays super-crisp) and rest for 20 minutes (stays warm up to 1 hour). Then slice using a serrated knife. Serve with gravy. Don't pour gravy over crackling – pour it off to the side! See note for reheating. Transfer fat to saucepan: Skim off 3 tablespoons of fat from the roasting pan and put in a saucepan. Strain pan juices: Place strainer over bowl and scrape in all the remaining pan juices (including onion and garlic). Press out juices; then discard onion & garlic. Skim off excess fat from surface and discard – no need to be exact here! Gravy roux: Heat the saucepan with the fat over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Add liquids: Pour stock in while whisking so it's lump free. Then pour in strained pan juies. Thicken: Simmer until thickened to syrup consistency – about 3 minutes – it will thicken more as it cools a little while serving. (Note 4 for colour tip) Season: Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Pour into serving jug. Serve with pork.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pavlova-christmas-tree-dessert/, Preheat oven to 150°C / 300°F (130°C fan) (We drop the temperature down later). Set the oven shelves in the centre and lowest racks. Draw circles: Take two sheets of baking/parchment paper and; using a pen that shows on the other side of the paper; trace circles around bowls; cookie cutters; scone cutters or glasses as follows:Tray 1: 15cm; 12cm; 6.5cm (6″; 4.8″; 2.5″) diameter roundsTray 2: 10cm; 8.5cm; 5cm; 4cm (4″; 3.5″; 2″; 1.7″) diameter rounds Turn the paper over and bake on the unmarked side (otherwise pen may stain pav). Soft peaks: Place egg whites in a bowl of a stand mixer and beat on Speed 8 for 1 1/2 minutes. (Note 5)  Add sugar gradually: With the beater still going; add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time until all used up – it should take around 90 seconds. Beat 6 min: Beat for a further 6 minutes (still on Speed 8) until thick; glossy and no sugar grains remain (rub between fingers to check). Add cornflour & vinegar: Stop beater; sift cornflour over surface. Add vinegar. Beat on speed 8 for a further 30 seconds. Test: Flip bowl upside down. Meringue should be stiff enough that it does not fall out! If it does; keep beating. Fit a piping bag with a large 1.2cm / 1/2" diameter star shaped piping nozzle; fill with meringue mixture. (Note 6 for alternatives) Pipe tight coils; leaving a 1.2cm / 1/2″ border within the guidelines for the decorative edge (except the two smallest ones; they are too small for decorative rims). Then do another coil on top (ie two layers) so they are 2cm / 4/5″ thick. Smooth surface. Pipe decorative edge; if using (I just do tight up-and-down swirls; see video). Repeat for all rounds. (Note: Pavs will expand ever so slightly but will not rise) Place Tray 1 on middle shelf in oven; Tray 2 underneath. Turn oven DOWN: Immediately turn oven DOWN to 120°C/250°F (100°C fan). Bake 1 hour. Check to ensure base of large ones are fully crisp and dry; not wet & sticky. You should be able to lift off without sagging – be GENTLE; it's fragile until dried out. Cool 3 hours IN oven: Turn oven off. Leave pavlova to fully cool in oven; at least 3 hours; maybe longer. I often leave overnight. In this step; the outside of pav dries out and becomes more sturdy. The pav should be fully crisp and dry to touch. Store until needed in airtight containers; in a cool; dry part of your house (I keep mine in the downstairs laundry! Note 9) Place ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer 5 minutes; mashing with fork. Puree with stick blender (strain if you want; I do not). Cool fully before use. Whip cream just before building – do not whip in advance and keep in fridge; it deflates. Place cream; vanilla and sugar in a large chilled bowl. Beat on high for 5 minutes until stiff. (Go beyond soft; lightly whipped; we need the structure!). Refrigerate until the very moment until you start buildling. Be prepared: Have everything out; ready to use. Construct at or near where you plan to serve. Layer 1: Place largest Pavlova Round on serving platter. Spread with 1cm / 2/5" thick layer of cream; right to the edge. Place 4 strawberry pillars around the edge; onto which the next layer will rest. Gently press them into the cream so they rest on the pav surface. Scatter some chopped strawberries in the middle of the pillars – not too many as we do not want to weigh the pav down. Drizzle with raspberry coulis; especially near the edge so it oozes out prettily. Spread with a bit more cream to cover the strawberries – make sure the cream is level for the next layer. Stick a skewer into the centre; pointy end up. Layer 2: Thread the centre of the next largest Pavlova Round onto the skewer; spinning back and forth gently to "screw" it through rather than pushing it through. It won't shatter – pav is tougher than you think. Repeat the cream; strawberry pillars; strawberry dice; coulis and cream steps above. Repeat Layers 3 to 7: Continue this with layers 3 to 7; finishing with the smallest meringue. You will only need 2 strawberry pillars on the smaller layers; and 1 under the centre of the smallest. If the skewer isn't long enough; thread through another one for the upper part of the tree. With each layer; check that the tree is straight and level. Use strawberries to level up the layers. Star topper: When the smallest Pavlova is placed on the very top; finish with a dollop of cream; small drizzle of coulis. Then insert the star; plus a raspberry and sprig or rosemary! Decorate with sprigs of rosemary; and insert raspberries onto the edges between layers (halve if necessary; to fit); using them to level out crooked layers; if needed. Dust with icing sugar and then serve immediately! The top 2 layers are single serving size. The next 2 layers will serve 2 people each. The bottom 4 layers can be cut like traditional Pavs and will easily serve another 8 – 10 people.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sticky-glazed-christmas-chicken/, Mix Marinade ingredients in a jug. Pour over chicken in a large ziplock bag (Note 2). Massage to coat; then marinate chicken for ideally 24 hours (bare minimum is 3 hrs; 12 hrs is ok). Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Line 2 trays with foil then parchment/baking paper (you'll thank me later). Distribute chicken on trays; then pour the marinade over. Roast 30 minutes. Roast for a further 20 minutes; basting with pan juices 2 or 3 more times until the chicken is deep golden and sticky. At first; the juices will be watery but in the final 10 minutes or so; they will thicken and darken. Once this happens; baste more frequently and heavily. (Note 4) When the top tray is almost ready; switch the tray positions (ie move bottom tray up and put the top tray undenerath) so they finish at the same time. GOAL: Deep golden and sticky  chicken!  Before plating up; baste again with the sticky juices. Serving suggestion: Spread leafy greens on a platter; pile on sticky chicken. Decorate with orange slices or wedges.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cauliflower-salad/, Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Toss cauliflower with oil; salt and pepper. Spread on tray; roast 20 minutes; turn; then roast for a further 5 to 10 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the cauliflower is cooked through. Don't let it get overcooked; sad and soggy! Transfer to bowl and let cool for 20 minutes. Turn oven down to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan). Spread hazelnuts on tray then roast for 5 minutes until they smell amazing.  Cool slightly; then roughly chop (most skin will naturally fall off). Place hazelnuts; parsley and celery into the bowl. Sprinkle over cinnamon; allspice; salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil; maply syrup and vinegar. Toss gently with hands or rubber spatula. Plate up: Taste; add more salt or pepper if needed. Transfer to serving bowl. Scatter over pomegranates. Serve at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/rosemary-crumbed-rack-of-lamb/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (all oven types). Place shelf in the middle of the oven. Season: Sprinkle lamb rack with salt and pepper. Sear: Heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat. Sear lamb rack all over until nicely browned – including each short end – about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. It will be fully raw inside; but that's OK. Transfer to plate and let cool for 5 minutes; uncovered. Mustard Spread: Mix dijon; rosemary and garlic in a small bowl. Then add 3 teaspoons of egg; and mix again. Making the crumb: Mix Crumb ingredients EXCEPT butter in a bowl. Then use a fork to stir through butter. Spread on a dinner plate (large enough that fits lamb). Crumbing the lamb: Spread the underside of the rack with mustard mix. Press into breadcrumb mixture; then spread mustard mix over the other side as well as each end. Then press those sides into the breadcrumb mixture. Transfer lamb to rack set on a tray. Surround with parboiled vegetables if using – but don't crowd the lamb. Roast: Frenched racks for 20 minutes; or untrimmed racks for 30 – 35 minutes; or until internal temperature registers 60°C/140°F (for medium rare). Rest meat: Transfer lamb to a cutting board; loosely cover with foil. (If you roasted veg; leave in tray or pan and keep warm in turned off oven). Carve: Rest 5 minutes then slice carefully using your hands to hold the crumb gently in place where you are cutting using a very sharp knife. If your service allows it; it's best to cut 2 or 3 bones together (ie. a double/triple cutlet portion); because the crumb stays on better. Slicing single cutlets is super hard (sadly)! Serve as-is (no sauce); with Creamy White Wine & Mustard Sauce; or Pea Puree.  Boil wine and chicken stock together until reduced by 3/4; then whisk in cream and mustard and simmer for 3 – 5 minutes until thickened. The consistency should be a thin pouring sauce. We don't want to coat the lamb too thickly as the sauce flavour will be overpowering.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-cauliflower/, Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Toss cauliflower in a large bowl with oil; salt; pepper and garlic if using. (You can do this on the tray; but you’ll need more oil). Add parmesan and Panko breadcrumbs at this point; if using. Spread on tray. Roast 20 minutes. Flip cauliflower; roast a further 5 minutes until you have golden edges and it’s soft all the way through. Serve immediately; sprinkled with parsley if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-cut-cauliflower-florets/, Cut whole cauliflower in half down the middle. Then again to make 4 quarters. Cut the core out on the diagonal. Use your hands to break into florets. If you end up with some large ones; use a knife to cut into half or even thirds so all the florets are roughly the same size – this will ensure they cook through evenly. Use as directed by recipe!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pea-puree-side-sauce/, Aromatics: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and eschalots; saute 3 minutes until soft; but don't let them go golden. Cook peas: Add frozen peas and stock; increase heat to bring to simmer then cover and reduce heat to medium. Simmer 2 minutes. Reserve Liquid: Remove 1/3 cup liquid from the saucepan; reserve. Blitz: Transfer all peas and remaining liquid into a food processor. Add salt and pepper; and mint if using. Blitz on high for 1 minute until smooth. Optional straining: For extra smooth; press through a mesh colander with a rubber spatula (it's easy). Adjust consistency: Use Reserved Liquid as needed to achieve the desired consistency – I like a soft; dolloping consistency. Sometimes people want it looser. Add more salt and pepper if desired – remember; this is not supposed to be strongly flavoured or seasoned! Serve warm. Either dollop/smear onto plates; or serve in bowls for people to help themselves.
https://www.recipetineats.com/french-bistro-salad/, Quick Pickled Eschalots: Stir sugar in vinegar until dissolved. Stir in eschalots; then leave for 30 minutes until it becomes floppy and turns pink. Drain. Dressing: Shake Dressing in a jar. Assemble: Pile lettuce on a platter (flatter better than deep bowl). Drizzle with about 1/2 the Dressing then toss gently with your hands. Scatter over fresh herbs; pickled eschalots and walnuts. Drizzle lightly with more Dressing. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/tomato-salad-with-olive-tapenade-very-french/, Season tomatoes: Place sliced tomatoes into a bowl. Sprinkle over the salt and toss well but gently. Leave to sit for 15 mins; then drain off any liquid the tomatoes have dropped. Meanwhile make the tapenade. Pit olives if required. Combine olives; capers; garlic; anchovy and vinegar in a blender or food processor. Smaller is better; eg. a Nutribullet. Add 4 tbsp of olive oil and blend until a rough paste forms; scraping down the sides as you go. If the paste is very thick and you are having trouble blending; add another 1 tbsp of olive oil to help it along. You should have a nice paste that’s combined to a smooth but not super-fine puree (we want a little character); and isn’t excessively oily. Drain your tomatoes one last time; then arrange slices overlapping on a large plate or platter. Dollop over the tomatoes 1/3 of the tapenade; or as much as you feel you want. Garnish with parsley leaves. Drizzle salad with a little more olive oil (~1 tbsp). Serve with some remaining tapenade on the side so people can help themselves.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-asparagus/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Snap the woody ends off the asparagus – it will naturally break at the right point. Pile onto tray. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt; pepper and garlic. Toss; then spread out on tray. Roast 7 minutes; or until ends have a bit of colour on them and the asparagus is just cooked through. It will take 10 – 12 minutes for very thick ones. Don’t let them get wrinkly and sad! Remove from oven. Toss with lemon juice; if using. Pile onto serving platter; grate over optional parmesan. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-chicken-salad/, Dressing: Shake Dressing ingredients in a jar. Set aside 10 minutes to let flavours meld. Toss: Place all Salad ingredients in a very large bowl. Pour over half the Dressing and toss well. Set aside 5 minutes (veg will soften slightly; making it more "slaw-like"). Toss again: Just before serving; toss again then add most of the remaining Dressing. Taste then add more Dressing if you want.  Serve sprinkled with lots of peanuts! (Note 6)
https://www.recipetineats.com/gingerbread-men/, Whisk Dry Ingredients on one bowl. Cream butter & sugar – In a separate bowl; cream the butter and sugar together using a stand mixer or electric beater on speed 7 for 2 minutes; or until light and fluffy. Egg & vanilla – Add the egg and vanilla; then mix on speed 5 until combined (~30 sec). Molasses – Add the molasses; mix for 1 minute using speed 2. Gradually add dry ingredients – Add 1/4 of the Dry ingredients; then mix until you can't see flour (start on speed 1 to stop flour flying everywhere!). Repeat until all Dry ingredients are mixed in; then mix for further 15 seconds. Dough should be soft and a bit sticky – see video for texture. Refrigerate – Pat dough into a disc shape; wrap in the cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until firm. (Can refrigerate 5 days or freeze 3 months). Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C (170°C fan) and set a shelf in the middle. Line 3 x baking trays with parchment/baking paper. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut into half. Wrap half and return to the fridge. Roll out (Note 7)- Sprinkle a sheet of baking paper very lightly with flour. Place dough on top; sprinkle surface very lightly with flour. Place another sheet of baking paper on top. Roll dough out until 4mm / 1/6" thick using a rolling pin. As you work; flip and if paper is wrinkling; peel it off then put if back on; smoothing out wrinkles. Cut out shapes (Note 8) – Use a gingerbread cookie cutter to cut out gingerbread men shapes; firmly pressing to cut all the way through. If the dough sticks to the cutter; dip it into flour. Transfer – Use a palette knife (or large knife) to transfer shapes onto baking sheet. Place 6 on the first sheet. Tidy edges if necessary using a butter knife. Bake Tray 1 – Bake for 12 minutes (for classic light golden) or 14 minutes (dark golden and crisp). Then remove and cool fully on tray. Repeat – Meanwhile; gather scraps of dough; press together then roll out again. If dough is sticky; return to refrigerator and work on the other half of the dough instead. Repeat rolling out and cutting out. You should have 18 to 20 gingerbread men in total (depending on cutter size) Trays 2 & 3 – Fill and bake 2nd and 3rd tray with gingerbread men; 6 to 8 on each tray. I find the workflow that works best is baking one tray at a time ie. roll/cut-out/fill/bake one tray while you prepare the next. Decorate – Fully cool on trays; then decorate! Use a half batch of this Royal Icing recipe to pipe and stick on decorations (sets hard and doesn't soak into cookies). The recipe makes more than you need; but it's impractical to make less. So freeze leftovers in fully sealed piping bag for future use.
https://www.recipetineats.com/spring-salad/, Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add snow peas to pot; boil for 1 1/2 minutes. Add the asparagus spears; boil for another 1 1/2 minutes. Add frozen peas; and boil for another 30 seconds or until the water just returns to a simmer; and peas turn bright green. Immediately drain; refresh vegetables under cold running water until cooled to stop cooking process. Remove the asparagus and snow peas; blot with paper towels to dry. Leave peas in colander to drain; giving them a toss now and then to help them dry. (It's important to dry vegetables; otherwise it dilutes the dressing and it won't stick. You could use a salad spinner with care; o just let them naturally dry which is easier.) Split the larger baby cos leaves down the middle; use the small ones whole. Cut asparagus stems in half on a slight angle. Shake Dressing ingredients in a jar. Combine vegetables in a bowl; dress and toss. Arrange salad on a platter (Note 5). Top with small chunks of goats cheese. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-joint-creamy-sesame-sauce-lettuce-salad/, Separate; wash; trim and dry lettuce leaves. Slice any large ones in half vertically. Leave smaller leaves whole. Sauce: Mix all ingredients except water together in a bowl. Start by mixing in 3 tbsp water; a tablespoon at a time. Let the sauce sit for one minute. If the sauce starts to split; or the sauce is too thick; add another tablespoon of water. Keep doing this until you have a pourable / drizzle-able sauce that is emulsified (ie. oil is not separated). Arrange leaves on platter; drizzle around half of the dressing over or so. You will NOT need all the dressing; keep the rest for something else. Garnish with sesame seeds. (Alternative: just use to dip in raw veg. It is SO good!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-bread-topped-leftover-turkey-pot-pie/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types) Topping: Stir together melted butter and garlic. Place bread chunks in a bowl; drizzle over butter; toss. Set aside. Brown mushrooms: Heat oil in an oven-proof skillet over high heat. (Note 3) Add mushrooms and cook until browned – about 4 minutes. Remove. Sauté garlic & onion: Lower heat to medium high. Melt butter in same skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add carrot then cook for 1 minute. Add flour; cook for 1 minute. You'll have a pasty mix. Don't worry if it looks dry (depends how sweaty your onions get). Make roux: While stirring; add half the milk and mix quickly to dissolve the paste into the liquid (this happens quite quickly). Add remaining liquid and stir. Add stock powder; salt and pepper; stir. Thicken sauce: Cook for 2 – 3 minutes; stirring regularly. It should start steaming and bubbling a bit; and the sauce will thicken. Thickness test: coat back of wooden spoon; you should be able to draw a line across it (see video; Note 3) Add turkey; peas and mushrooms; and mix into sauce. Top with bread; spread to cover surface. Grate over parmesan if using; top with melting cheese. Bake: Bake for 12 – 15 minutes or until the cheese gets some brown spots. Tent foil over so it doesn't stick to the cheese; then bake for a further 10 minutes. Serve: Sprinkle with additional parmesan if desired; then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/baby-potatoes-with-butter-herbs/, Boil potatoes: Place potatoes in a large pot of cold tap water with 1 tbsp salt. Bring to a boil over high heat; then lower heat to medium so they're simmering gently (this stops skin splitting). Cook for 10 – 15 minutes until there's no resistance when pierced with a knife. Alternatively; steam the potatoes. Steam dry: Drain in colander then leave for a minute to let the potatoes steam dry (if wet; butter won't stick). Toss with butter: Transfer to a bowl; add salt; pepper and butter. Toss to melt and coat. Add herbs just before serving. Stir through; transfer to serving bowl and serve warm!
https://www.recipetineats.com/peach-salad/, Cut peach: Halve peaches. Remove seed. Cut each half into half again. If your peaches are really large; cut each half into thirds. Dressing: Combined dressing ingredients in a jar and shake well. Toss rocket in ~2 tbsp of dressing. Mozzarella: Tear mozzarella into pieces. Assemble: Arrange rocket; peaches; mozzarella on a large plate or platter. Drape prosciutto around salad. Drizzle remaining oil over the salad. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/changs-crispy-noodle-salad/, Toast almonds: Lightly toast the slivered almonds in a small skillet over medium heat until lightly browned (no oil). Remove immediately and let cool. Dressing: Shake Dressing ingredients in a jar until sugar is dissolved. (This keeps for 3 weeks!) Shred cabbage: Cut cabbage (see photos in post; helpful): cut 1 slit down the middle lengthwise (or 2; if it's giant like the one I used). Then finely slice so it's shredded. Just use the top 1/2 – 2/3; mostly leafy part. Reserve the thick crunchy white part for another use (excellent in stir fries!). Toss everything except crispy noodles: Place cabbage in a big bowl with toasted almonds and green onions. Pour over Dressing; toss well. Add crispy noodles! Toss through noodles just before serving so they stay crisp!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crostini-4-delicious-crostini-toppings/, Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (all oven types). Brush bread with oil; sprinkle with salt; flip and repeat. Bake 5 minutes.  Remove; then rub the surface lightly with garlic. Bake for a further 5 minutes until completely crispy; then remove and leave to cool fully before adding toppings. Place all ingredients except balsamic glaze in a bowl and gently toss. Taste and add more salt & pepper if desired. Spoon onto crostini; then drizzle with balsamic glaze. Done! Mix cream cheese; lemon zest; lemon juice; dill; salt and pepper. Spread on crostini; then fold salmon pieces on top. Top with 3 capers and sprig of dill each. Serve! Finely chop antipasto mix. Smear crostini with ricotta; pile on antipasto. Ready! Cook prawns: Toss prawns with 1 tbsp oil; garlic; salt and pepper. Preheat large skillet over high heat with 1 tbsp olive oil. Add half the prawns and sauté until just cooked. Remove; then repeat with remaining prawns. Cool; then chop into 0.75cm / 1/3" pieces and transfer to bowl. Add 1 tbsp olive oil; eschallots; coriander and lime. Toss; then add more salt and pepper to taste. Assemble: Smear crostini with avocado; then spoon on shrimp. Serve! No; wait – Eat one yourself; then serve. Because they'll be gone before you can even put the plate down; trust me! 😂 Spread crostini with goats cheese. Layer strawberry slices. Drizzle with honey just before serving and sprinkle with thyme leaves. Spread crostini with as much English Mustard as you dare(!); then cream cheese. Drape with a slice of beef; top with sprig of rocket. Mix chopped tapenade ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to let the flavours meld; then taste and add salt if required. Spread crostini with goats cheese. Pile on tapenade. Serve! Pea puree: Boil peas per packet directions until soft; then drain well. Transfer to small bowl with high sides. Add garlic; parmesan; olive oil; salt and pepper. Blitz with handheld blender stick until smooth. Stir through mint and lemon juice. Set aside to fully cool. Prawns: Peel then chop meat into 0.75 – 1 cm pieces. Assemble: Smear crostini with pea puree. Pile on prawn; drizzle with olive oil; sprinkle with parsley and chilli.
https://www.recipetineats.com/leftover-celery-salad/, Remove the leaves from the celery and trim off the dirty base. Finely slice on the diagonal into 4mm / 1/6″ slices. Toss in a bowl with remaining ingredients. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving. Keeps for up to 3 days in the fridge – the celery softens and becomes even more pickle like.
https://www.recipetineats.com/ny-times-famous-broccoli-salad-with-sesame-cumin-garlic/, "Cook" raw broccoli: Toss broccoli in red wine vinegar; salt and pepper. Set aside 10 minutes – it will lightly pickle; almost "ceviche" the broccoli. Garlic; spice and oil mix: Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cumin seeds and red pepper flakes. Cook; stirring; until garlic is light golden. Stir in sesame oil. Toss broccoli: Immediately pour oil mix over broccoli. Toss very well using a rubber spatula to scrape up all the oil from the side of the bowl. Marinate: Leave on the counter for at least 1 hour to marinate; or refrigerate for up to 48 hrs (it gets better with time). Serve at room temp; not cold; for best flavour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-lentil-soup-beef-mince-recipe/, Mix spices in a small bowl. Saute onion & garlic: Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Cook onion and garlic for 3 minutes until golden on the edges.  Brown & spice beef: Turn heat up to high; add beef and cook until it's no longer red; breaking it up as you go. Add 2 tablespoons of the Spice Mix and cook it for a further 2 minutes – it will smell so good! Carrot & celery: Add carrot and celery; then stir for 1 minute. (If using your own veg mix; add the veg in this step that will hold up to full 25 min simmer time) Make broth: Add water; beef stock; canned tomato; lentils and remaining Spice Mix too. Give it a stir; bring to simmer; then place lid on and reduce to medium low so it's simmering gently. Lentils will take 25 – 30 minutes to cook until soft. Very old lentils can take 5 – 10 minutes longer. Simmer 15 minutes then add zucchini & green beans. Simmer 10 minutes longer or until lentils are soft (ie. 25 minutes total). Serve! Taste and add more salt if desired. Ladle into bowls and serve with yogurt and coriander.
https://www.recipetineats.com/bitter-leaf-and-orange-salad-with-orange-poppyseed-dressing/, Put leaves into a large mixing bowl. Tear or cut any large leaves into smaller bite size pieces. Peel oranges and remove skin and all outer pith (white part) using a knife. Slice into 0.7 cm / 1/3″ thick wheels and deseed. Alternatively; segment oranges. Add to leaves. Mix or shake Dressing ingredients in a jar until sugar dissolves. Dress salad and toss.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pomegranate-salad-with-pomegranate-dressing/, Remove leaves: Grab the base of the stalk then run your fist up the stalk to remove the leaves. Slice: bundle the kale leaves on a chopping board; then slice 0.5 cm / 1/5" thick. Scrunch: Place in bowl; drizzle with olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Use your hands to scrunch in order to soften leaves and coat everything with the oil. Do this for 20 seconds. Leave for 30 minutes to marinate – leaves  will soften. Try it – much tastier than plain raw! Toss: Place walnuts in a bowl; drizzle with honey; sprinkle with cinnamon and salt. Mix; spread on paper lined baking tray. Bake: Bake at 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) for 15 minutes; tossing once halfway. Leave to cool; then use fingers to roughly break walnuts up into slightly smaller pieces. Place ingredients in a jar and shake very well; being sure that there is no molasses left on the bottom of the jar. (Shake in jar is better than whisking to bring this dressing together). Cut pomegranate in half. Over a bowl; turn cut face downwards; then use a wooden spoon to (very!) firmly smack the back of the pomegranate. The seeds will fly out through your fingers into the bowl. It's very satisfying!!! Keep smacking all over the skin until the seeds are all out. Pick out any white pith that fell out; then use seeds per recipe. You will probably get some juices pooling in the bowl; add this to the dressing too. Peaches; nectarines: Halve; remove stone; then cut into 4mm / 1/6" slices. Grapefruit; oranges: Cut off peel and pith; then segment (see this video at 41 sec for demo) Dress greens lightly: Place kale and spinach leaves in a giant bowl. Drizzle with about 3 tablespoons of Dressing then toss very well. Layer half: Pour half kale/spinach into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with 1/3 EACH of walnuts; blue cheese (crumbled); pomegranates; orange segments; and cranberries. Presentation layer: Top with remaining kale & spinach; then remaining walnuts; blue cheese; pomegranates; orange segments and cranberries. Drizzle over remaining dressing just before serving. Serving: Best served freshly assembled but this salad will hold up much better than most because kale doesn't go as soggy once dressing; it's even good the next day!
https://www.recipetineats.com/slightly-sweet-salty-butter-popcorn-keep-crispy/, Pop the kernels using your method of choice – either popcorn maker or stove (see next section) Heat fat: Melt clarified butter in a large pot over medium high heat (medium for strong stoves). Add a few kernels of popcorn and wait until they pop – this means the oil is now hot enough. Quickly remove test popcorn. Add popcorn: Add remaining popcorn; lift pot off stove to shake and spread corn out evenly. Cover with a lid and return to heat. Once the popping really gets going; shake the pot gently once.  Done! Remove from heat when the popping largely stops (3 seconds between pops) and transfer to a (very!) large bowl.  Place salt in a mortar and pestle then grind into a fine powder. You could also do this using a spice grinder. You won't use it all; but it's harder to work with a smaller quantity than this. Drizzle melted clarified butter all over the popcorn surface. Sprinkle with half the salt; then use small sieve to dust with half the icing sugar. Toss very well in large bowl. Then sprinkle with remaining salt and dust with remaining icing sugar. Toss well again. At this stage you can add more sugar or salt; to your taste. The above quantities make it slightly salty and lightly sweet which to me is the perfect balance!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-lemon-herb-baked-risotto-recipe/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Heat stock: Heat up the chicken stock until just before boiling using whatever method suits – stove or microwave. Pour everything into casserole dish: Pour the stock into a small casserole pot ~24cm/10" wide. Then add all the remaining Risotto ingredients – rice; butter; onion; garlic; pepper. Bake 35 minutes: Cover with lid or foil; bake 35 minutes or until rice is just cooked – tender but not mushy. The risotto will still look liquidy – that's what you want to ensure risotto is creamy at the end! Stir vigorously: Remove from oven; stir ta few times to break up rice. Add finishing butter and parmesan; then stir vigorously until the watery liquid becomes creamy; and mostly evaporates/gets absorbed. Goal – oozy and creamy:The risotto should be oozy and creamy; not thick; gluey or stodgy. If it gets too thick; add 1 tbsp of boiling water at a time to loosen it up; stirring well after each addition. Taste for salt: Taste for seasoning and adjust (I find it's just right). Serve asap! Serve while hot and creamy; topped with more parmesan if desired! Add lemon rind; juice and herbs; stir through gently just before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-skin-salmon/, Dry skin: Pat the skin of the salmon very well with a paper towel until dry. If time permits; place the salmon skin side up in the fridge for 1 hour (uncovered;) to dry it out even more. Season: Drizzle flesh side with half the oil (just a tiny bit) and rub over skin. Sprinkle with half the salt and pepper. Turn fillet over and repeat. Do not do this step until just before cooking. Heat oil: Put enough oil in a large non stick skillet so it fully covers the base. Heat on medium high until it shimmers (but not smoking).  Skin side down: Place salmon in the skillet skin side down; then immediately turn the head down to medium. Press down: Using a spatula or something similar; press down on each salmon for 10 seconds so the skin is pushed flat against the skillet and "sets" its form. If you can do at least two at a time that is ideal. Cook 7 minutes: Cook for 7 minutes; or until the salmon is cooked 3/4 of the way through (you will see the colour changing up the side of the salmon) and the skin is crispy. 90 sec on flesh side: Flip the salmon to skin side is up and cook for a further 90 seconds. Final skin blast! (My secret tip) Flip the salmon again to skin side down; turn the heat up to medium high and cook the skin side again for 60 seconds; just to give it a final blast of heat to reinforce crispiness! Serve skin side UP to protect the crispy skin. Fish skin will only stay crispy while it's hot; so serve immediately! Pictured in post with creamy Lemon & Herb Risotto which acts as a side dish and semi-sauce (super easy no-stir recipe!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-mirror-glaze/, Refrigerate cake layers for at least 1 hour until well-chilled (for easier handling). Then trim cake to make it level and frost cake with chocolate ganache so it's smooth and level (follow the tutorial in this post: How to Frost Cakes Smoothly). After the ganache is smooth and level; refrigerate for at least 1 hour before coating with Mirror Glaze. Bloom gelatine: Place water in a small bowl. Then sprinkle gelatine across surface; mix just so all the powder is wet. Leave for 5 minutes – it will become like a rubber consistency. (This is called "blooming gelatine".) Whisk cocoa and water: Place cocoa and water in a medium saucepan then mix until virtually lump-free. It will be like a paste. Add cream and sugar: Add a splash of cream to cocoa mix and stir. It will loosen up. Add remaining cream and sugar; then GENTLY continue to mix to combine. Do not mix vigorously and do not use a whisk (Note 7). Bring glaze to boil: Turn stove onto medium high heat. As soon as it comes to the boil; remove from the stove. Dissolve gelatine: Add gelatine lump; then GENTLY stir until it dissolves and you have a smooth glossy glaze. (There may be some white foam; that's ok.) First straining: Using a shallow bowl and small fine mesh strainer; strain the glaze into a bowl. Pour and position the strainer so the glaze falls the smallest distance possible. If you pour from a height; this creates bubbles = bad! Bubble check: Twist the bowl back and forth between your hands rapidly. This will make any bubbles rise and gather in the centre. If you see bubbles; see "Note 8: Bubble Troubleshooting". Cool glaze: Cover with cling wrap; pressing the cling wrap onto the surface of the glaze to prevent a skin from forming. Cool on the counter for 2 hours until it reaches 30°C/86°F. See Note 9 for overnight refrigeration. Second straining: Just before pouring over the cake; strain the glaze into a jug. As before; tilt the jug and strainer as you pour the glaze in to minimise the distance the glaze falls. Transfer cake to rack: Remove cake from fridge; transfer onto a rack. (See Note 9 for how I do it.) Place rack on a tray to catch excess glaze. Pour over mirror glaze: Starting at the centre of the cake; pour the glaze on; moving in an expanding spiral motion gradually towards the outer edge of the cake; to make the glaze spread across the surface and drape like curtain down the sides. For the most perfect surface; try to do it in one motion without breaking the pour. Pour with confidence in a thick stream rather than a thin drizzle (which might set too quick and leave drips). Ensure all sides are fully coated – if not; quickly do a little pour down the sides to coat the naked patches. Transfer cake to platter: Before the mirror glaze sets (takes ~10 minutes); move the cake to a cake platter (Note 9 again for my cake-shifting method). Fix blemishes – Use excess glaze on the tray and in the jug to fill gaps and tears. Then smooth over with a warmed palette knife (either lightly warm with a blow torch or dip into warm water and wipe). See video for demo. Fill a tall jug with warm tap water. Dip a knife in; then wipe dry. Make one slice into the cake.  Clean knife; dip in warm water and dry again. Make your second cut to get your wedge. Pull wedge out and marvel at the perfect layers before continuing to cut more slices! See notes for storage.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-ganache/, Using a sharp knife or serrated knife; finely chop the chocolate. Then scrape it all into a heatproof bowl – including all those little powdery shards! Heat cream: Place cream in a small saucepan over heat or in a heatproof jug to microwave. Heat until hot and steaming but DO NOT let it boil – it might cause the chocolate to split or go grainy. (Note 6) Pour cream over chocolate: Pour hot cream over chocolate; then spread chocolate out so it's as evenly covered by cream as possible. Cream will not fully cover white or milk chocolate; that's OK.  Wait 10 minutes: Leave for 10 minutes. Do not cover (Note 7). Stir until smooth: Using a rubber spatula or spoon; stir until cream and chocolate are incorporated and it's silky smooth. (Note 8 about lumps) Milk & white chocolate only: Because there is less cream; the chocolate may not fully melt. In which case; micrwoave for 20 seconds; stir gently; then microwave again for 10 seconds and stir – this should be enough to fully melt the chocolate. (Note 5) Troubleshooting: If your ganache splits (ie. oil streaks) or is grainy; or it's too thick or thin; see above in post for how to fix these problems. Cooling: If cooling your ganache (to spread; pipe or whip); cool it uncovered for 30 minutes. Then cover with cling wrap and press so it contacts the surface (so you don't get a skin forming) and continue to cool. Pourable / dipping sauce / pour glaze – allow to cool for 15 minutes on the counter until it's still runny but pourable. Use as required – pour over cakes as a thick chocolate glaze; over sundaes; into bowls to use for dipping; or to make drip decorations. Spreadable frosting – cool to a spreadable peanut butter consistency. Cool 30 minutes on the counter then EITHER 4 hours in the fridge; stirring every now and then for even cooling; OR refrigerate overnight and then leave to soften on counter for 15 – 20 minutes. Whipped Ganache – Place bowl and whisk attachment in fridge for 20 minutes. Place ganache in bowl then whip on high for 2 minutes until it changes to a pale brown colour and it's fluffier. Smear or pipe onto cakes and cupcakes. Truffles – cool overnight in the fridge until firm. Use this Chocolate Truffles recipe. More ideas and uses – Click here: What to do with chocolate ganache !
https://www.recipetineats.com/sauteed-brussels-sprouts-in-carbonara-sauce/, Prepare brussels sprouts: Trim the woody end off; halve; then remove scraggly and loose outer layers. Cook bacon: Place bacon in cold non stick skillet; then turn the stove on medium high (Note 4). Cook bacon for 2 to 3 minutes until golden; then remove with a slotted spoon. Reserve some fat: Discard excess bacon fat; leaving behind 2 tablespoons (or so). If you're short; add a dab of butter or olive oil. Sauté brussels: Add brussels sprouts and cook for 3 minutes; stirring every now and then; until the cut face becomes light golden. Add garlic; salt and pepper; then keep sautéing for another 1 minute or until the cut face become golden. Braise in stock: Add chicken stock then lower heat to medium and simmer for 4 – 5 minutes; stirring every now and then to encourage even cooking; until the brussels are almost cooked through (check with a knife). Don't let them cook through completely – we will be simmering a little more. Add cream and stir. Simmer for 2 minutes to reduce. Add parmesan and cheese. Stir until melted; then simmer for a further 1 minute to to let the sauce thicken more and for the brussels sprouts to finish cooking through. (Note 5 on sauce thickness) Check for salt: Taste and add more salt if needed (I usually find it doesn't need any more.) Sprinkle with bacon: Transfer to serving bowl; sprinkle with cooked bacon and serve hot!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pasta-alla-norma-eggplant-pasta/, Preheat oven to 240°C / 450°F (220°C fan). Line a tray with baking / parchment paper. Toss eggplant with oil; salt and pepper. Spread on the tray and roast for 20 minutes. Flip; then roast for a further 5 minutes. Cool on tray (this helps the eggplant hold its shape when tossing). Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Start cooking the pasta a couple of minutes after you start making the sauce (next section); until al dente or to your liking. Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook for 20 seconds until golden; then add onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent and cooked through. Increase heat to medium-high and add wine; if using. Let it simmer; scraping the base of the pan to deglaze; until the wine mostly evaporates. Add tomato passata. Now pour the water into the passata bottle; screw on the lid; shake; and pour that in too (waste nothing!) Add dried herbs; red pepper flakes; salt and pepper. Stir and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in eggplant; then add cooked and drained pasta. GENTLY toss until pasta is coated in the sauce (so the eggplant doesn't turn into complete mush!). Serve immediately; garnished with a good pinch of fresh basil and parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-barbecue-pork-char-siu/, Cut pork in half to make two long strips. (Note 5) Mix Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Place the pork and Marinade in a stain proof container or ziplock bag. Marinate 24 to 48 hours in the fridge (3 hours is the bare minimum). Preheat oven to 160C/320F. Line a tray with foil and place a rack on top (recommended but not critical). Remove pork from the marinade; save Marinade. Place pork on rack. Roast for 30 minutes. Meanwhile; pour reserved marinade in a saucepan. Mix Extra Honey into marinade. Bring to simmer over medium high and cook for 2 minutes until syrupy. Remove from heat. Remove pork from oven. Dab marinade all over; then turn. Baste then roast for a further 30 minutes. Remove pork from oven. Brush with marinade again; then turn; brush with marinade and roast for a further 20 minutes. If charring too quickly; cover with foil. Baste again on surface then bake for a further 10 minutes until caramelised and sticky. Meat should be tender but not falling apart; like with pulled pork. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with rice and steamed Chinese greens. See notes for more uses!
https://www.recipetineats.com/fondant-slow-roasted-sweet-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 240°C/465°F (220°C fan). Cut the potatoes into 3cm / 1.2″ discs. Place the potatoes in a large roasting pan or baking sheet with tallish sides (we're adding liquid later). Drizzle with butter and oil; sprinkle with half the salt and pepper. Squidge around; turn potatoes; sprinkle with remaining salt and pepper. Roast: Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Turn; continue roasting: Carefully turn potatoes; then roast for a further 15 minutes. Baste; add stock: Spoon the butter/oil collecting in the pan over the potatoes. Then carefully pour the stock in around the potatoes; and scatter the garlic into the liquid. Roast to absorb stock: Return to the oven; and roast for a further 15 to 20 minutes or until most of the liquid has been absorbed/evaporated. The exact time depends on the height of pan walls / how heavy-based your pan is etc. Assemble & serve: Transfer potatoes to serving platter; scraping up some of the pan juices as you go (Note 5); and piling them high on the plate. Pour over Maple Butter Pecan Sauce and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves just before serving. Serve warm – or at room temperature! Place pecans in a saucepan or small skillet over medium high heat. Stir for 30 seconds until you can smell the pecans. Add remaining ingredients; then once the butter melts and it starts bubbling; simmer on medium heat for 1 1/2 minutes until it reduces and thickens slightly (it gets thicker as it cools). Transfer to serving jug. Serve over potatoes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-breast-in-creamy-mushroom-sauce/, Split breast: Cut each breast in half horizontally to form 4 thin steaks in total. Dust with flour: Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper; then sprinkle with flour and use your fingers to spread it all over the surface. Cook chicken: Melt 15g butter in a large non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook each side for 2 1/2 minutes until golden brown and just cooked through. Remove from pan; cover and keep warm. Cook mushrooms: In the same frying pan; add remaining butter and increase heat to high. Add mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes; until starting to turn golden brown on the edges. Add garlic later: Then add garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper; and continue cooking for another minute until both garlic and mushrooms are golden. Deglaze skillet: Add white wine – it will bubble and be steamy! Cook for 30 seconds; scraping the bottom of the pan; until wine is mostly evaporated and the alcohol smell is gone. Make creamy sauce: Add chicken stock; cook vigorously for 1 minute so it mostly evaporates. Then add cream; lower heat to medium and simmer for 2 minutes until it reduces and thickens slightly. Add parmesan: Stir in parmesan; taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Finish chicken in sauce: Return chicken to sauce for 30 seconds (to warm through slightly.) Garnish with chives and serve as-is in the pan; for people to help themselves (or transfer to serving platter; if you prefer). Alternatively; serve a portion of chicken onto each plate; spoon sauce over and garnish with more chives. Sides: Ideal served with mashed potato or rice – something to soak in that amazing sauce! See Note 5 for suggestions.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-and-bacon-breakfast-strata-cake-bread-bake/, Cook bacon: Heat a large non-stick frying pan over high heat. (Use a bit of oil if not using non-stick). Add all but 2 tbsp of bacon (reserve some for topping just before baking); cook until lightly browned. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper towel. Whisk eggs and milk: Whisk the eggs; milk; salt and pepper in a large bowl (or container; if leaving overnight). Soak bread: Add the bread; 1 1/2 cups of the cheese and the cooked bacon to the egg mixture. Mix well. Cover and set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (until all the egg is soaked into the bread) or overnight. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).  Grease cake tin: Generously grease a 20cm/8" springform cake tin with butter (cake pan without loose sides also ok; also see Note 3 re: leakage risk).  Fill: Pour the bread mixture into the cake tin; pat down to compress. Scatter with reserved uncooked bacon and remaining 1/2 cup of cheese. Cover loosely with foil. Bake for 25 minutes; then remove the lid and bake for a further 15 – 20 minutes until golden on top and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean (no raw egg).  Rest & slice: Allow to rest for 5 minutes before removing the springform or turning out. Garnish with parsley if using. Cut into slices to serve. Be civil and eat it on a plate with a fork; or just use your hands!
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-pumpkin-with-yogurt-sauce-and-pine-nuts/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Line a tray with baking/parchment paper. Peel; deseed and cut pumpkin into 3cm / 1.2" cubes – see photos in post for how I do it with little effort. You should end up with about 1 kg – enough to fill a tray. Place pumpkin in a bowl; add garlic; salt; pepper and olive oil. Toss well using a rubber spatula. Spread on tray. Roast 20 minutes. Turn pumpkin pieces; then roast a further 7 to 10 minutes until nicely coloured but holding it's shape; rather than being a mushy mess. Mix ingredients then set aside for at least 10 minutes to let the flavours develop. Preheat skillet over medium high heat (no oil). Add pine nuts and cook; stirring regularly; until it smells amazing and it's got a hint of browning on both sides. Remove from pan. Pile the pumpkin in a mound on a plate. Drizzle over yogurt sauce; add a little drizzle of olive oil; then sprinkle with sumac; pine nuts and coriander. I think it's best served with the pumpkin hot or warm; but for a warm summer day; it is also excellent served at room temperature. Just cool pumpkin; then dress and garnish just before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/general-tsos-chicken/, Sauce-Marinade: Mix the soy; hoisin; vinegar; chilli and sesame oil. Marinate Chicken: Take out 2 tablespoons of Sauce-Marinade and mix with chicken. Add ginger and garlic to chicken; mix; then marinate 30 minutes. Dust chicken: Add cornflour into chicken and toss to coat; ensuring pieces are separated so they get fully coated. Shake off excess: Tip into a colander and shake to remove excess cornflour (or grab handfuls; shake so cornflour falls through your fingers). Finish Sauce: To the remaining Sauce-Marinade (that you made in Step 1); add sugar and cornflour. Mix; then add chicken stock and mix.  Heat oil: Heat 2 cm / 4/5" oil in a deep skillet (or large pot – whatever you’re comfortable with) to 200°C/390°F. To use less; see Note 4. Fry: Cook chicken 3 minutes; turning halfway; until golden and crispy. Drain on paper towel lined plate. New / clean skillet: Discard oil; wipe skillet and return to heat. Or use another large skillet. Stir Fry Sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; ginger; chilli flakes; saute 30 seconds until garlic is light golden. Add Sauce; bring to simmer and stir occasionally until it thickens enough that you can draw a path across pan base. Toss! Add chicken; toss to coat quickly – the quicker you are; the crispier the chicken stays! Transfer to serving plate; garnish and serve immediately with your rice of choice.
https://www.recipetineats.com/flourless-orange-cake/, Boil 10 minutes: Place oranges in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil over medium high heat. Boil for 10 minutes and drain. Repeat x 2: Put oranges back in the pot; cover with cold water and boil again for 10 minutes. Drain; then repeat once more (ie. boil oranges 3 x 10 minutes). Shortcut: Boil 40 minutes without draining; keeping an eye on water level. (Note 4) Chop: Rinse oranges; then cool slightly so you can handle them. Slice into 1cm / 1/4" slices then dice; removing any seeds. Cool completely. Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan). Grease and line a 23cm/9" cake pan with baking/parchment paper. (Note 5) Blitz oranges: Place chopped oranges in a food processor (Note 6). Blitz on high for 4 x 10 second bursts; scraping down the sides in between; until it's pureed into a marmalade consistency with only a few visible bits of rind remaining. It does not need to be completely smooth. Blitz in remaining ingredients: Add almond meal; eggs; baking powder and sugar. Blitz for 5 – 10 seconds on high until combined. Bake 60 minutes: Pour into prepared cake pans. Bake 60 minutes until the surface is golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool: Cool fully in cake pan. Unless using loose base pan; cover surface with baking paper to help you turn it out (cake is sticky so may stick to your hand and tear surface otherwise.) Serve: Decorate as desired – I used slices of fresh oranges; rind strips and sprigs of flowers. A dusting of icing sugar / powdered sugar is also lovely. Cut; then serve! See Note 7 for suggestions.
https://www.recipetineats.com/potato-rosti/, Peel then grate the potatoes using a box grater; trying to get nice long strands if you can. Grab handfuls of potato and squeeze out excess liquid; then place in bowl. This helps make the potato crispier (otherwise all that water has to steam out in the pan). Add butter; salt and pepper then toss. Don’t worry if your potatoes go brown/reddy – it’s still safe to eat; and turns white again when cooked. Melt half the clarified butter in a 26cm / 10.5" (or thereabouts) non-stick pan or skillet over medium low heat. Shallow non-stick pan with sloped sides is best for easy rosti removal. Place the potato in pan; but do not pack down. Use rubber spatula to tidy the edges; then lightly pat down to even surface. Cook first side: Cook 12 minutes until underside is very golden and crispy; lifting edge with rubber spatula to check. If by 8 minutes it is not going golden; increase heat. TIP: Insurance policy – If you didn't use a non stick pan; slide the rubber spatular underneath all the way to the middle and run it around; to be 100% sure nothing is stuck before attempting flip. Flip: Cover pan with a round wooden board with a handle (or anything similar with a handle; Note 3). Holding the handle of the board; flip quickly – and with confidence! Cook second side: Melt remaining clarified butter in the pan; then slide the rosti back in and cook for 12 minutes until golden crispy; and there is no resistance when a knife is inserted into the middle. Slide onto cutting board; cut into 4 or 6 wedges and serve immediately! Use 25g / 1 1/2 tbsp clarified butter for each batch; medium heat in a non stick pan. Place potato in rounds in a skillet; around 8cm / 3" wide; 1.5 – 2cm / 2/3" thick (without patting down). Cook 5 minutes until deep golden and crispy; flip; and cook another 5 minutes until done. Transfer to rack set over tray in a 120°C/250°F oven until ready to serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-make-ghee-and-clarified-butter/, Use a small or medium saucepan or small skillet with a silver base so it's easier to see when milk solids are golden. Put butter in then let it melt over medium-low heat. Leave to simmer for 10 minutes – it will start to foam at about 5 minutes; then at 7 minutes most of the foam will be gone; and by the end the foam should be almost all gone. The ghee is ready when the milk solids that settle on the base of the pan turn golden. Strain through a mesh colander lined with a single sheet of paper towel. Then pour into a jar for storage. Keep in the pantry 3 months (firms to peanut butter consistency); or fridge 1 year (hardens like butter). Use in place of butter or fat for pan frying; roasting; sauces. The smoke point of ghee / clarified butter is 230°C / 450°F which is considerably higher than common oils such as vegetable oil and olive oil; so it won't smoke and burn. Use with caution in baking recipes – such as cakes and cookies.
https://www.recipetineats.com/goan-fish-curry-indian/, Place Curry Paste ingredients in a tall jug or milkshake container (something that fits the head of a blender stick) then blitz on high for 5 to 10 seconds until the onion is pureed. Add more water if needed to make it puree. Sizzle black mustard seeds: Heat oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add black mustard seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds – careful; they might pop! Saute onion: Add red onion and cook for 3 minutes until edges start to tinge with gold. Cook off curry paste: Add curry paste and cook for 3 minutes – to evaporate water; make spices bloom and cook garlic & ginger. Cook off tomato: Turn heat up to medium high. Add tomato paste and tomato pulp; cook for 2 minutes. Coconut milk: Add water; coconut milk; sugar; salt and chilli powder if using. Stir; then bring to simmer; low heat so it's bubbling gently. Simmer 2 minutes; add tomato & green chilli: Simmer for 2 minutes; add tomato and green chilli. Simmer 3 minutes: Simmer for another 3 minutes; stirring every now and then – sauce should be thickened (not watery); it gets looser again when fish is added (because fish will drop some juices = even more flavour!). Add fish: Add fish; stir; cook for 3 to 4 minutes until fish easily flakes. Garnish & serve: Remove from stove and transfer to serving bowl. Garnish with coriander/cilantro and fresh green chillies if desired. Serve with basmati rice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/eggs-benedict/, Preheat oven to 50°C/120°F. Cook bacon in a little oil or butter to your liking. Transfer to small baking pan; cover with foil then place in oven. Ham – if using ham; cover and place in oven to warm slightly. Lightly toast English muffins then keep warm on rack on tray. Place egg yolks in a tall narrow jug that the blender stick fits in; all the way to the base. Add water; lemon juice; cayanne pepper and salt. Blitz briefly to combine. Melt butter in a heatproof jug until hot (be very careful to ensure it doesn't explode if using microwave!). If you use a stove; pour into a jug. Let it stand for just 15 seconds until the milky whites settles at the bottom of the jug. (Note 2) With the blender stick going on high; slowly pour the butter in a thin stream into the eggs over around 45 seconds. Leave behind most of the milky whites in the butter – about 1 1/2 tbsp. (Note 2) Once all the butter is in; the sauce should be thick; creamy; smooth and pale yellow. Now blitz for a further 10 seconds; moving the stick up and down. Thickness – If too thick; mix in warm tap water 1 teaspoon at a time. It should be thick but pourable so it will coat and stick to the eggs but not be transparent. Keep warm – Transfer to a bowl; cover and keep warm – it will stay warm for 15 min but even room temp is fine (will heat up when in contact with hot eggs). Strain eggs – Crack an egg into a small strainer set over a bowl or glass. Leave for 30 seconds and jiggle around a bit so watery whites strain through. Transfer to teacup. Repeat for another 3 eggs – separate teacup for each Heat water – Fill a large pot with 7.5 cm / 3" water. (Note 4) Bring water to the boil over high heat; then turn the heat down so there are tiny bubbles from the base of the pot but big bubbles are not breaking water surface. (Note 5) Roll eggs into water – Submerge a teacup into the water so you can gently roll the egg out onto the base of the pot – minimise the drop distance for neatest shape. Repeat with remaining eggs – don't take longer than 15 seconds to put them all in. Turn eggs – 20 seconds after the first egg has gone in; eggs should be starting but are not fully set. Use a slotted spoon and tablespoon/dessert spoon to gently turn the eggs upside down – start with the first egg that went in; end with the last. Poach 1 1/2 minutes – Leave for 1 minute; then turn again. Leave for another 30 seconds then using a slotted spoon; lift one out to check for doneness – whites should be soft but set; yolks should be runny. Drain – Transfer to paper towel to drain and for top to dry with residual heat – 15 seconds. (Don't leave for too long or it can get stuck to the paper towel.) Place 2 English muffins halves on a plate. Pile on ham; bacon or smoked salmon. Top with poached egg; spoon over Hollandaise Sauce; sprinkle with parsley and chives. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/poached-eggs/, Crack an egg into a small strainer set over a bowl or glass. Leave for 30 seconds and jiggle around a bit so watery whites strain through. Carefully transfer to a teacup. Repeat for as many eggs as you plan to make in one batch (Whirlpool max 2; Easy Method up to 6); one in each teacup. For both methods; bring water to the boil over high heat; then turn the heat down so there are tiny bubbles from the base of the pot but big bubbles are not breaking water surface. (Note 4) Fill a pot with 7.5 cm / 3" water. (Note 3) Bring to boil then lower heat; per above directions. Submerge a teacup into the water so you can gently roll the egg out onto the base of the pot - minimise the drop distance for neatest shape. Repeat with more eggs; but don't take longer than 15 seconds to put them all in. 20 seconds after the first egg has gone in; eggs should be starting to but are not fully set. Use a slotted spoon and tablespoon/dessert spoon to gently turn the eggs upside down - start with the first egg that went in; end with the last. Leave for 1 minute; then turn again. Leave for another 30 seconds then using a slotted spoon; lift one out to check for doneness - whites should be soft but set; yolks should be runny. Drain & serve: Transfer to paper towel to drain and for top to dry with residual heat - 15 seconds. (Don't leave for too long or it can get stuck to the paper towel.) Serve! See below for ideas. Fill a large saucepan or small pot with 7.5 cm / 3" of water. Add vinegar; if using (I don't). Bring to boil then lower heat; per above directions. Using the handle of a flat-handled wooden spoon; stir the water quickly (10cm/4" diameter circle) to create a whirlpool so the vortex ("V" shape in water) stays for 7 seconds. (Note 5) Carefully slip the egg into the middle of the vortex; with the teacup as close to the water as possible but do NOT touch the water - it will break the water motion. The spinning water will make the whites wrap around itself so it forms a lovely poached egg shape once it stops spinning (~ 15 seconds). Leave for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes - after 30 seconds; you can rotate once or twice; or swirl water again if you want to do it for you. Using a slotted spoon; lift out to check for doneness - whites should be soft but set; yolks should be runny. Drain & serve: Transfer to paper towel to drain and for top to dry with residual heat - 15 seconds. (Don't leave for too long or it can get stuck to the paper towel.) Serve! Multiple eggs: Use 15 cm / 6" of water. Once the first egg has set (~ 30 sec); swirl water again and drop in another. I've seen experts do 4 eggs. I prefer the Easy Method! Store in cold water - Use either method above; and place cooked eggs in a large bowl of cold tap water which stops the eggs cooking further. If making a lot; use ice water to ensure water temperature stays down To reheat: Bring a large pot of water to the boil; then turn heat down to low. Transfer eggs straight from cold water into hot water; leave 30 seconds - they will not cook in this time; but will just reheat. Drain on paper towels; then serve! Serve on toast; perhaps smeared with avocado; on asparagus or make Eggs Benedict! Great also on homemade baked beans and even a Caesar salad!
https://www.recipetineats.com/hollandaise-sauce/, Place egg yolks in a tall narrow container that the blender stick fits in all the way to the base. Add water; lemon juice; cayanne pepper and salt. Blitz briefly to combine. Melt butter in a heatproof jug until hot (be very careful to ensure it doesn't explode if using microwave!). If you use a stove; pour into a jug. Let butter stand for just 15 seconds or so until the milky whites settles at the bottom of the jug. (Note 2) With the blender stick going on high; slowly pour the butter in a thin stream into the eggs over around 45 seconds. Leave behind most of the milky whites in the butter – about 1 1/2 tbsp. (Note 2) Once all the butter is in; the sauce should be thick; creamy; smooth and pale yellow. Now blitz for a further 10 seconds; moving the stick up and down. Thickness: If too thick; mix in warm tap water 1 teaspoon at a time.  Salt adjustment: Add a touch of extra salt if using for something non salty like asparagus; leave salt as is if pairing with salty foods like Eggs Benedict; steak; fish.  Lemon adjustment: Make it slightly more tangy that you want if using for something like Eggs Benedict; steak or salmon (because it's diluted when you eat it; and also balances the rich food). But make it perfectly lemony to your taste if using for something like Asparagus. Using: Use immediately; or keep warm until required – if covered and wrapped in a tea towel; it will stay warm for 15 minutes. Use warm or at room temperature. Use warm tap water for loosening. See note for storing and reheating.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-rice-soup/, Combine broth ingredients: Place chicken stock; soy sauce; Chinesse cooking wine; garlic and ginger in a small pot over high heat.  Simmer to infuse: Place lid on; bring to simmer then reduce to medium and simmer for 5 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. Add rice: Add rice and cook uncovered for 10 minutes – broth surface should be bubbling very gently. Add fish & stems: Add fish and stems of choy sum; cook for 2 minutes. Pick garlic and ginger out of soup.  Stir through choy sum leaves (they will wilt almost instantly); sesame oil and pepper. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-garlic-prawns-shrimp/, Place prawns; garlic; oil and pepper in a bowl. Toss to coat; set aside 20 minutes if time permits (no longer). Stir through salt just prior to cooking. Melt 15g / 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add half the prawns and cook for 1 minute on each side; then remove. Repeat with remaining prawns (you shouldn't need more butter); then remove. Scrape out excess remaining garlic from pan and add to cooked prawns. Add butter into skillet and let it melt. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds or until light golden. Add white wine; turn up heat to high. Bring to simmer while stirring base of the pan to dissolve all the golden bits into the sauce. Cook 1 minute or until it most evaporates and the winey smell is gone. Add chicken stock and reduce until mostly gone and just a thin layer remains on base of skillet. Add cream; then simmer on medium heat for 2 minutes until reduced and slightly thickened. Stir through parmesan; then add the prawns back in. Taste sauce and see if more salt and pepper is needed. Serve sprinkled with parsley; over mashed potato or something to soak up that fabulous sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/white-bean-tabbouleh-salad/, Place Dressing ingredients in a jar and shake well to combine. Place Salad ingredients in a big bowl. Drizzle over most of the Dressing; toss well. Transfer to serving bowl. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/bread-and-butter-pudding/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types) Egg Mixture: Place eggs in a large bowl; whisk briefly. Add remaining Egg Mixture ingredients and whisk. Soak Bread: Add bread and sultanas; briefly mix; then set aside for 3 minutes to allow egg mixture to soak through the bread. Transfer to baking dish: Pour into a baking dish (10 cup / 2.5 litre / 2.5 quart). If you have lots of sultanas on the surface; poke them below the surface (Note 3). Drizzle then bake: Drizzle over melted butter; then bake for 25 – 30 minutes or until golden on top and the inside is set but still slightly wobbly (poke to check). Brush with remaining 1 1/2 tbsp melted butter (optional); then dust with icing sugar. Serve – rest for a few ninutes; then serve immediately; with toppings of choice! My favourites are ice cream; custard and cream.
https://www.recipetineats.com/ceviche/, Cut fish: Cut fish into 1.25cm / 1/2" cubes. Toss in lime; leave 5 minutes: Place in a bowl with onion; jalapeño; tomato; pepper and lime juice. Gently toss; then set aside for 5 minutes; mixing gently once. Add avocado then serve! Sprinkle over salt; then add avocado; coriander and olive oil. Gently stir; then serve immediately with corn chips (see in post for other ideas). Ceviche will be good for 20 minutes or so; then fish will start to overcook and firm up. Do not leave overnight (for food safety reasons).
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-pasta-bolognese/, Saute onion & garlic: Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Cook garlic and onion for 2 minutes until translucent. Cook beef: Add beef and cook; breaking it up as you go. Add tomato: Once beef has all changed from red to brown; add tomato passata. Rinse out bottle: Pour some beef stock into the empty bottle; shake; then pour into the pot. Add everything else: Add remaining beef stock and all remaining ingredients except spaghetti. Give it a good stir; then let it come up to the boil. Add spaghetti: Add pasta; fanning it out around the pot. Leave for 30 seconds to start softening; then start pushing it in under the liquid. Cook pasta: Once fully submerged; cook for 12 minutes; stirring every minute or so; and more towards the end. At about the 8 minute mark; lower the heat to medium otherwise the base might catch (but ensure it is still bubbling gently – you don't want pasta just bloating in warm water). Remove from stove; toss well: Take it off the stove once the pasta is JUST cooked; the tiniest bit firmer than you want; and when still saucy. Toss it for about 30 seconds or so – the sauce will reduce further; the pasta will finish cooking. Serve immediately; garnished with parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-satay-curry/, Combine Satay Seasoning ingredients in a small bowl. Marinate – Combine chicken with 3 1/2 TABLESPOONS Satay Seasoning and onion in a bowl. Marinate for at least 3 hours; preferably overnight; minimum 20 minutes (Note 6) Cook – Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non stick skillet over high heat (Note 7). Cook chicken in 2 batches until browned all over but still raw inside. Transfer to bowl; cover and keep warm. Saute aromatics – Using the same skillet; turn heat down to medium and heat 1 tbsp oil. Add chill; onion and garlic cloves. Sauté until onion is translucent – around 2 minutes.  Satay Seasoning – Add remaining Satay Seasoning and cook for 1 minute. Blitz – Transfer to a blender or small food processor (I use a Nutribullet). Add chicken stock and 1/2 cup of the peanuts (rest gets added later). Puree until pretty smooth – some peanut chunks can remain. Pour mixture back into the skillet. Add remaining ingredients into sauce – Add remaining 1/4 cup peanuts; kecap manis; dark soy sauce; coconut milk and peanut butter. Stir to combine. Add kaffir lime or lemongrass – Crush kaffir lime leaf in hand a bit (to break leaf to release the flavour). Add kaffir lime leaf OR lemongrass and chicken to sauce.  Simmer – Bring to simmer; turn heat down to medium low and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened. Serve – Add lime juice to taste. Serve with rice (jasmine; white rice or brown rice). Garnish with peanuts; cilantro/coriander leaves and more chilli if desired. See Note 9 for suggested sides.

https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice/, Rinsing rice: only required if you purchased from bulk bins. If you rinse; reduce water by 1/4 cup for baked version. Boil water: Bring water to a boil in a small pot or large saucepan over high heat. Boil rice: Add rice; then boil rice until just cooked; a tiny bit firmer than you want (it gets softer during Rest step). Use these times as a guide (Note 3):– Medium and long grain rice: 30 minutes– Basmati rice: 12 minutes (1st check) to 14 minutes Drain VERY well (key tip! Note 4): Drain rice in a colander; shaking the pot well to remove as much water as you can; and shaking the colander to remove excess water from the rice. Pot should steam dry from residual heat.  Rest: Return rice to now-dry pot. Put lid on and put it back on the turned off stove. Leave for 10 minutes. Fluff and serce: Fluff rice with fork and serve. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Combine rice and water: Pour rice and boiling water into a 20cm/8" square pan or round casserole pot. Cover with lid or foil. Bake 1 hour 15 minutes. Rest; fluff & serve: Remove from oven; stand 10 minutes then fluff with fork and serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vanilla-cupcakes/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) for 20 minutes before starting the batter (Note 8). Place shelf in the middle of the oven. Place cupcake liners in a standard muffin tin. (Note 9) Whisk Dry: Whisk flour; baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Heat Milk-Butter: Place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter. Do not let milk bubble and boil (foam ok). Cover and leave in microwave to keep very warm (stove: cover with lid and leave on turned off stove). (Note 10) Mix eggs: In a separate; preferably heavy based glass bowl; beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a handheld beater. Add sugar: With the beater still going; pour the sugar in over 30 seconds. Beat until tripled: Beat eggs for 6 minutes on speed 8; or until tripled in volume and almost pure white. Add flour: When the egg is whipped; scatter 1/3 flour across surface; then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Stop beating; add half remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 – 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can’t see flour; stop straight away. Temper milk: Pour hot milk; vanilla and oil into the now empty flour bowl. Add about 3/4 cups of the Egg Batter into the hot milk (don't need to be 100% accurate with amount). Use a whisk to mix until smooth – you can be vigorous here. Will look foamy. Slowly add milk: With the beater on Speed 1; pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds; then turn beater off. Scrape and final mix: Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds – batter should now be smooth and pourable. Fill muffin tin: Pour batter into muffin tin; filling 2/3 of the way up. Do not fill more (causes flat / sunken surfaces). Easiest to use a standard ice cream scoop with lever. Bake 22 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into middle comes out clean. Remove from oven. Cool just 2 minutes then use a fork to help remove and place on cooling rack. Cool completely before icing with frosting of choice (Note 11 for ideas); or cream and fresh berries or jam. 
https://www.recipetineats.com/fluffy-vanilla-frosting/, Place flour and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook; stirring constantly; for 30 seconds. While whisking constantly; slowly pour the milk in (this ensure it’s lump free). As the milk gets hotter; it will start to thicken – stir constantly so the base doesn’t catch. Cook until the mixture thickens in a thick; dolloping custard – see video for texture. TIP: Thicker texture = thicker frosting texture but won't make the frosting dense; it's still fluffy and spreadable but it just makes it "sturdier" with sharper edges when piped. Remove from heat and scrape into a bowl. Cover with cling wrap; pressing down onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Cool completely (I leave on counter for 20 min or so then refrigerate 30 min to speed up but don't let it get chilled; best at room temp to beat into butter). You can leave in fridge overnight but take it out 1 hour prior to using (to dechill – otherwise it won't mix well with softened butter). Place butter in a bowl and use either a handheld beater or stand mixer (with whisk attachment) to beat for 3 minutes until it's smooth and changes from yellow to very pale yellow; almost white. Now start whipping in the Thickening Roux. On speed 5 (medium); start adding the thick roux one heaped tablespoon at a time. Take about 1 minute to add it all. Once all added; add vanilla and salt; then whip for 2 to 3 minutes until you can see that it is still enough to hold peaks. Then it's ready to use! Beat in the cocoa powder at the end; just until mixed through. Use it like any other frosting on cakes and cupcakes – either spread it on with a knife or put in a piping bag. You can pipe sky-high mounds and it will hold its form; as pictured on Vanilla Cupcakes in this post.  See notes for storage / make ahead. 
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-parmigiana/, Sprinkle both sides of chicken with salt; pepper and Italian herbs. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent. Add red pepper flakes and herbs; stir for 15 seconds. Add wine; turn up heat and let it simmer rapidly until mostly evaporated and winey smell is gone. Add tomato; chicken stock; salt and pepper. Cover; then simmer 10 minutes on low until thickened. Cover and keep warm. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Crumbing set up: Spread flour out in a shallow bowl. Whisk Egg Dredge in a separate shallow bowl. Mix Crumbing ingredients in a third shallow bowl or pan. Dredge & crumb: Press both sides of chicken into flour; then shake off excess. Coat in egg; letting excess drip off; then place in Crumbing; pressing to adhere. Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining chicken. Line a tray with paper towels and place rack on tray. Heat 1.5 – 2cm / 2/3″ oil in a skillet over medium high heat to 180°C/350°F (Note 9). Carefully place 2 or 3 pieces of chicken in. Cook 2 minutes until underside is golden; then carefully turn and cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to rack; then repeat with remaining chicken. (Note 12 – oil clean and reuse) Place chicken on a tray. Spoon 1/3 cup sauce over the chicken – cover around 80% of the chicken; leave the ends crispy. Sprinkle sauce with basil; then mozzarella cheese (pile it on in mounds to use it all up); then sprinkle with parmesan. Drizzle oil over parmesan. Bake 15 minutes until cheese is melted and there’s a few brown spots – no longer; otherwise chicken will overcook. Remove from oven; sprinkle with extra basil if desired. Serve immediately (with leftover Tomato Sauce; if you'd like!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/crustless-quiche-ham-and-cheese/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Grease a 22.5cm / 9" pie dish with butter or spray lightly with oil. (Note 4) Whisk eggs; cream; salt and pepper. Scatter most of the ham; cheese and green onion in the pie pan. Pour in egg mixture. Top with remaining ham; cheese and green onion. Bake 35 minutes until golden on top and centre barely wiggles. Don't overcook; it will lose custardy-ness. Remove from oven; rest 5 minutes and watch it deflate! Cut then serve with a simple side salad; or stuff into soft rolls; or wrap into burritos (then pan fry to crisp!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/bbq-beef-ribs-slow-cooked/, Coat ribs in rub; mix sauce except water in pan; then add water. Bake ribs in sauce covered 3.5 hrs at 160°C/320°F; turn; then 30 min uncovered. Serve! Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F (both fan & standard). Rub – Mix Rub in a small bowl large; enough to fit one rib. Press beef ribs into the rub; coating all sides. Shake off excess. BBQ Sauce – Mix Barbecue Sauce ingredients; except water; in a baking pan. Then mix in water. Coat – Place ribs in sauce; turning to coat. Arrange meat side down in the sauce; bone side exposed (sauce won't cover completely; that's ok). Bake 3.5 hours  – Cover tightly with foil or lid; bake 3 1/2 hours. Remove from oven; remove foil. Turn ribs (some may have fall over; that's ok; just turn them). Spoon over sauce. Bake 30 min – Bake 30 minutes uncovered; spooning over sauce again halfway through; until surface is caramelised and sticky. Check to ensure ribs are tender – pry a bit apart using two forks. (If not; cover and return to oven; but after 4 hrs they certainly should be!) Serve – Remove ribs onto serving plate (use a spoon as meat will barely be attached to bone; if at all). Mix sauce to bring together (Note 3 on adjustments). Serve with ribs! (See below for serving suggestions)
https://www.recipetineats.com/mushroom-pasta/, Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta into the pot when you start cooking the mushrooms. Cook pasta per packet instructions minus 1 minute. RESERVE 1 mugful of pasta cooking liquid; then drain pasta. Melt half butter and all oil in a large skillet over heat. Add mushrooms and cook until water has leeched then evaporated; and the mushrooms start to turn golden around edges  – around 5 minutes.  Halfway through cooking; add salt & pepper. Add garlic and remaining butter; cook for 2 minutes until mushrooms and garlic are golden. Add pasta; about 3/4 cup of reserved pasta water and parmesan. Toss gently or until water reduces and thickens into a saucy glaze that coats the pasta. If the pasta dries out; add more pasta water. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Remove from stove and serve immediately; garnished with fresh parsley and parmesan cheese.
https://www.recipetineats.com/green-beans-in-creamy-parmesan-sauce/, Place bacon in cold skillet; then turn the stove on high. (Note 2) Cook bacon for 2 to 3 minutes until golden; then remove with a slotted spoon. Discard excess bacon fat; leaving behind 1 1/2 tablespoons (or so). If you’re short; add a dab of butter (or olive oil). Add garlic and stir for 10 – 15 seconds until light golden. Add green beans and stir to coat in garlicky bacon fat. Add chicken stock; stir; bring to simmer then cover with lid. (Note 3) Cook 3 minutes; stirring every now and then so it cooks evenly; until beans are tender-crisp; still bright green and almost cooked to your liking (it will cook more). There should be some liquid left (if not; that’s ok too) Add cream; parmesan and pepper. Stir; bring to simmer then lower heat to medium low and let it gently simmer for 2 minutes until the cream reduces and becomes thicker. If you want it to stick to the beans thickly when warm; then reduce the sauce for another 1 minute until the sauce is quite thick. (Note 4) Taste and add salt if needed (I don’t find it needs more). Transfer to serving bowl; sprinkle with cooked bacon and extra parmesan if you like.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mongolian-lamb/, Combine lamb and marinade ingredients; mix very well. Cover and refrigerate to marinate and tenderise the lamb. Marinate 2 hours –  Backstrap; Midloin chops and other listed Tender Cuts in Note 1. Marinate 24 hours – lamb shoulder and other listed Economical Cuts in Note 1. (Bare minimum marinade times is 6 hrs). Sauce: Mix cornflour with the soy sauces; then mix in the remaining sauce ingredients. (Note 7) Cook onion: Heat oil over high heat in a wok or heavy based skillet. Add onions; and stir fry for 30 seconds until starting to colour. Add garlic and toss through quickly. Cook Lamb: Add lamb and cook for 3 minutes until most of it changes from red to brown; and some pieces start getting nice golden brown surfaces. Add Sauce: Add green onions; stir for 30 seconds (meat should all now be brown); then add Sauce. Stir and let simmer for 1 – 2 minutes until thickened. Serve with rice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/my-very-best-vanilla-cake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) for 20 minutes before starting the batter (Note 8). Place shelf in the middle of the oven. Grease 2 x 20cm / 8” cake pans with butter; then line with parchment / baking paper. (Note 9 more pan sizes) Best to use cake pan without loose base; if you can. Whisk flour; baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. 30 sec beat: Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a Stand Mixer fitted with a whisk attachment; or hand beater. Slowly add sugar: With the beater still going; pour the sugar in over 45 seconds. Triple volume: Then beat for 7 minutes on speed 8; or until tripled in volume and white. Heat Milk-Butter (Note 5): While egg is beating; place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter (or use stove).  Gently add flour: When the egg is whipped; scatter 1/3 flour across surface; then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Add half remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour; then mix on Speed 1 for 5 – 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can’t see flour; stop straight away. Combine milk; vanilla & oil – Pour hot milk; vanilla and oil into the now empty flour bowl.  Lighten with some Egg Batter: Add about 1 1/2 cups (2 ladles or so) of the Egg Batter into the Milk-Butter (don't need to be 100% accurate with amount). Use a whisk to mix until smooth – you can be vigorous here. Will look foamy. Slowly add milk: Turn beater back on Speed 1 then pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds; then turn beater off. Scrape and final mix: Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds – batter should now be smooth and pourable. Pour batter into pans.  Knock out bubbles: Bang each cake pan on the counter 3 times to knock out big bubbles (Note 10 for why) Bake 30 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean. Turn out & cool: Remove from oven. Cool in cake pans for 15 minutes; then gently turn out onto cooling racks. If using as layer cakes; cool upside down – slight dome will flatten perfectly. Level cake = neat layers. Frost: Once cake layers are fully cool; top with frosting of choice; or cream and fresh berries or jam. See list of ideas in post! Beat butter with paddle attachment in stand mixer for 3 minutes on high until it changes from yellow to almost white; and it becomes fluffy and creamy.  Add icing sugar / powdered sugar gradually in 3 lots; beating slowly (to avoid a powder storm) then once mostly incorporated; beat on high for a full 3 minutes until fluffy.  Add vanilla and milk; then beat for a further 30 seconds. Use milk only if needed to make it lovely and soft but still holds it's form (eg for piping). Use immediately. (If you make ahead; refrigerate then beat to re-fluff).
https://www.recipetineats.com/green-bean-avocado-salad/, Place all ingredients into a Nutribullet or small food processor and blitz until smooth (including any Extra Flavouring Options suggested in the standalone Creamy Avocado Dressing recipe). Use water to thin to just pourable consistency (so it's not super gloopy and thick). Taste and add the following to taste: salt; pepper; lemon; oil. Steam green beans using method of choice until soft (I microwave; 5 minutes on high). Drain then leave to cool and dry. Place remaining salad ingredients in a large bowl with the beans. Drizzle with half the Dressing. Toss. Serve with remaining Dressing on the side. Presention note: It looks a bit of a mess once tossed. If you're serving to impress; just drizzle the Avocado Dressing over and take to the table like that (see in post; it's much prettier!).
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-avocado-salad-dressing/, Place all ingredients into a Nutribullet or small food processor and blitz until smooth. (Inc Extra Flavouring Options) Use water to thin to just pourable consistency (so it's not super gloopy and thick). Taste and add the following to taste: salt; pepper; lemon; oil. Use as salad dressing!  Keeps 3 days in the fridge without going brown. See Note 3 for how to keep even longer!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-tetrazzini-pasta-bake/, Melt 2 tbsp butter in a large pot over high heat. Add chicken; sprinkle with pinch of salt and pepper. Cook 1 1/2 minutes until golden.  Turn chicken; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook 1 minute until golden then remove onto plate – doesn't need to be fully cooked (will cook more in oven). Rest 5 minutes; then chop into small pieces; or shred. Preheat oven to 160°C / 325°F. Cook mushrooms: Melt 4 tbsp butter over high heat in the same pot. Add mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes until starting to go floppy but not yet golden.  Add onion: Add garlic and onion; cook for 3 minutes until mushrooms are golden. Add a pinch of salt and pepper halfway through. Add flour & milk: Turn heat down to medium. Add flour. Stir for 30 seconds. Add milk and stir for 10 seconds or until it thickens (see video at 52 sec). Add cream and broth: Add chicken stock; cream; 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Stir; then let the mixture heat up; stirring every now and then so it doesn't catch on the base; and cook until the sauce thickens enough so you can draw a path on the back of the spoon (video at 1.04). Do not make it very thick – it gets thicker in next steps. Add cheese & pasta: Turn stove off. Stir through half the cheese (will melt in oven); then add pasta and chicken. Toss to mix; taste and add more salt if needed. Bake: Pour into 23 x 33cm / 9 x 13" pan; smooth surface. Top with remaining cheese. Bake 25 minutes until golden and bubbly. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/honey-chicken-stay-crispy/, Place batter mixing bowl in the fridge with the flour; baking powder and salt. (Helps keep batter cold = crispier chicken) Marinade: Mix Chicken and Marinade in a bowl. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Dust: Spread the 1/2 cup cornflour/cornstarch on a shallow plate. Scatter over about 8 to 10 chicken pieces; toss to coat; shake off excess; put on a plate. Repeat with all chicken. Rack: Place a rack on a tray (for draining; Note 3) Heat oil: Fill small pot or large saucepan with 4cm / 1.7" oil. Heat to 180°C/350°F on medium high stove (or until chicken starts sizzle straight away when dipped). Make Cold Batter: Whisk together flour; cornflour/cornstarch; baking powder and salt. Pour in 7 tbsp soda water; then do minimum whisks just to combine (10 or so) – few lumps ok; better than whisking too much (changes coating texture).  Batter thickness: should fully coat chicken easily; not be see through; but not thick and heavy – see video at 44 seconds. Use extra water 1 teaspoon at a time to achieve right thickness. Dredge: Drop 8 or so pieces of chicken into the batter. Turn to coat; then carefully place in oil. Fry #1: Cook for 3 minutes until light golden and crispy – when you pick them up; you can tell it's very crispy. Drain & repeat: Place on rack; repeat with remaining chicken – I cook in 4 batches; don't crowd the pot; brings oil temperature down too much. Cool chicken for 20 minutes (Note 4). Meanwhile; make Sauce. Place ingredients in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to simmer; then leave to simmer for 3 minutes. Consistency should be like maple syrup (video at 1 min 11 sec). Turn off stove; place lid on to keep warm (when cool; gets too thick to toss chicken). Heat oil to 200°C/390°F. Add in half the chicken (you can crowd the pot for Fry #2). Cook for 90 seconds until it changes from pale golden to very golden (but not dark golden; chicken will overcook); then remove onto rack. More golden = crispier chicken. Repeat with remaining chicken. (Feel the chicken – you can tell it's built-to-last crispy!) Tumble into saucepan with sauce; use rubber spatula to quick toss until coated with sauce. (Sauce starts thickening if you take too long; so be quick!) Pile chicken up over crispy noodles (if using); scatter with sesame seeds and green onion and serve! At any point while oil is hot; drop wad of noodles into hot oil; wait 3 seconds until it puffs up; then remove with tongs. Drain on paper towels; place on plate to top with chicken!
https://www.recipetineats.com/swiss-mushroom-burger/, Preheat oven to 220°C/450°F (200°F fan). Garlic butter: Place butter; garlic; salt and pepper in a heatproof jug. Microwave to melt butter; then stir. Brush with butter: Brush the mushroom cap with butter (smooth side); then place on a tray gills side up (ie stalk facing up). Brush remaining butter onto the rims and gills; being sure to scrape up all the garlic in the jug. Olive oil: Drizzle with olive oil.  Roast 25 minutes; then flip mushrooms. Brush with tay juices; roast a further 10 minutes or until the centre of the mushrooms are tender. {Meanwhile; cook onion; mix Sauce) Top with cheese: Place a slice of cheese on each mushroom; return to oven for 3 minutes just to melt the cheese.  Toast buns: Place split buns in the oven at the same time – to lightly toast. Spread base of bun with a dollop of Pink Sauce. Top with lettuce; then tomato; then mushroom; then onion. Spread lid with a lesser smear of Pink Sauce; then place on burger. Devour! Mix together; use per recipe. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook onion for 5 to 7 minutes until tinged with gold and floppy. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vegetable-samosa-pie/, Bring a pot of water to the boil then cook potato for 12 – 15 minutes until very soft. Drain; mash and set aside. Sizzling spices: Heat oil in a dutch oven or pot over high heat. Add black mustard seeds; cumin and fennel seeds. Let them sizzle for 15 seconds – careful; they might pop! Curry leaves: Then add curry leaves and stir for 15 seconds. Aromatics: Add garlic; ginger and onion. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until onion is tinged with gold. Tomato: Add tomato paste and tomato; cook for 30 seconds. Spices: Add curry powder; turmeric and chilli. Cook for 30 seconds. Most Veg: Add zucchini; carrot and cauliflower. Stir well to coat in the spice paste. Water: Add water; salt and pepper. Stir; bring to a simmer then put the lid on and reduce heat to medium low (so it's simmer gently). Cook & reduce: Cook for 15 minutes until vegetables are soft. Then remove lid and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce liquid a bit. Add mash: Remove from stove. Add peas and potato; mix through well. Taste: Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Cool: Place lid on and cool for at least 30 minutes (even overnight is fine). Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Grease a large pie dish with butter; or oil spray (Note 6). Drape in a puff pastry sheet.(I don't blind bake here – see Note 5) Fill with Filling – slightly mounded is fine. Fold in the corners of the puff pastry sheet. Top with puff pastry sheet – turn 90 degrees to the base puff pastry sheet (see photo). Fold the overhang puff pastry under itself – no need to be neat here; this is a rustic pie! Egg wash: Brush with egg; cut a 2cm / 1" cross in the middle (to let steam escape). Bake 50 to 60 minutes; until the top is very deep golden and flaky. Stand 5 minutes then slice to serve. A dollop of plain yogurt goes well with this!
https://www.recipetineats.com/sweet-and-sour-pork/, Mix Pork with Marinade. Marinade 18 to 24 hours. (See Note 1 for marinating time for other cuts) Rack & warm oven: Preheat oven to 80°C/175°F and place rack on tray – to keep pork warm. Sauce: Place all Sauce ingredients EXCEPT water in a large jug or small bowl. Mix until combined; then mix in water. Be Stir Fry Ready: Have all ingredients lined up; ready to toss in. After Fry #2; things move quickly. Coating #1: Mix 5 tablespoons cornflour into the pork and leave for 5 minutes. At first; it will be white from the cornflour; but after a while it will sweat and make the cornflour (mostly / partially) wet; and will be sticky (this is key for coating to stick). Coating #2: Spread 1/2 cup cornflour in a shallow bowl. Coat pork; shaking off excess; and pile onto a plate. Reserve cornflour in case you need to dust again just prior to frying. Pork should be at least half white when you put it into the oil (if not; just sprinkle with reserved cornflour). Heat oil: Pour enough oil into a large saucepan or small pot so it's 2.5cm / 1" deep. Heat to 180°C/350°F (or until pork immediately starts sizzling when you dip it in). Fry #1: Cook pork in batches; being sure not to crowd the pot; for 3 minutes until golden. Drain on rack. This step is just to cook the pork. It takes me 4 batches. Fry #2: Turn the stove up slightly and heat oil to 200°C/390°F. Starting with the coolest pork; add half the pork (you can crowd the pot) and cook for 1 1/2 minutes; or until pork is deep golden brown and crispy. Transfer to rack; repeat with remaining pork – I do 2 batches. Keep warm in oven. Heat oil in a very large skillet over high heat.  Add garlic; ginger and onion; stir for 1 1/2 minutes. Add capsicum and stir for 2 minutes. Add Sauce & pinapple; then let it come to a rapid simmer. Simmer for 2 minutes until it thickens – when you drag the spoon across the base; a path should briefly appear (see video at 1 min 53 s). 10 second toss: Add pork; then QUICKLY toss to coat – aim for 10 seconds! Serve asap! Pour onto serving plate; serve immediately! Will stay crispy for around 5 minutes then starts softening but still has a solid coating. This is just the reality of Sweet and Sour Pork; even at restaurants!
https://www.recipetineats.com/prawn-tacos-shrimp/, Mix Marinade ingredients in a bowl; then toss the prawns in the marinade. Set aside for just 20 minutes – no longer. Even 5 minutes is enough. Warm a serving bowl using any method (microwave 1 minute; hot water then dry). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add half the prawns and cook each side for 60 seconds (or on a BBQ on high heat; suggest double skewer for easy rotation). Transfer to warmed bowl; loosely cover with foil. Cook the remaining prawns. Serve with Slaw; Pink Taco Sauce; warmed tortillas and lime wedges. Place all ingredients in a very large bowl then toss well (I use my hands!). Set aside for at least 1 hour until the cabbage becomes wilted and floppy. Keeps for 3 days! Mix ingredients and adjust Sriracha to your taste. Mix well – sour cream becomes looser the more you mix it.
https://www.recipetineats.com/eggplant-curry-south-indian/, Preheat oven to 240°C / 450°F (220°C fan). Line tray with parchment/baking paper. Cut eggplant into 2cm / 4/5" slices; then cut into 2cm / 4/5" batons. Place in large bowl; toss with oil; salt and pepper. Spread on tray; roast 20 minutes. Turn; roast for a further 10 minutes – edges should be caramelised; soft inside; but they're not shrivelled up and dismal. Use per recipe. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add mustard seeds; let them sizzle for 15 seconds. Add curry leaves; stir; leave to sizzle for 15 seconds – seeds might pop; Indian cooking is very dramatic! Add onions; cook 5 minutes until golden brown. Add tomato; cook for 1 minute; stirring. Add garlic and ginger; cook 2 minutes. Add Curry Spices and salt; and cook for another 3 minutes – it will be  a thick paste and might stick to the bottom of the pot; don't let it burn (if it starts to; remove from stove and quickly add splash of water to loosen). Stir in water; and then add the eggplant. Gently stir; partially cover; reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes. Stir carefully once or twice (so the eggplants don't break up completely); add more water if it dries out. Stir in coconut milk; taste then add more salt if needed. Your result should be a very thick; juicy; strongly flavoured curry with eggplant partially intact but half collapsed. Serve with basmati rice and a dollop of yogurt and fresh coriander leaves; if you want.
https://www.recipetineats.com/blueberry-cheesecake/, Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan). Place shelf in middle of oven. Line inverted base: Get a 20cm/8" springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (Note 4); butter lightly then press on a square piece of parchment/baking paper. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out; see photos in post and video. Line sides: Butter and line the side of the pan. Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz until fine crumbs. Add butter; briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.(Note 5) Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls. Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I use a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides; and flatten the base. Cream cheese: Use a stand mixer (with paddle) or handheld beater to beat the cream cheese until just smooth; no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4. (You do not want to aerate cheesecake filling too much as it causes cracks when it bakes) Add flour; beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated.  Add vanilla; sour cream; sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 sec max; speed 4). Eggs: Add eggs one at a time – beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 in between each. After the last egg; beat as needed until batter is smooth – but stop beating immediately once smooth.  Blueberries: Stir in blueberries with a rubber spatula. Pour into prepared crust. Bake: Bake for 70 minutes. The top should be a bit puffed; very light golden brown; not cracked; and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan; see video at 1 min 23 sec (sets in next step). Cool: Cool the cake in the oven with the door open approx 20 cm / 8" for about 2 hours (Note 6); then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan or overnight. Cake will sink and surface should be flat. Release: Remove sides of springform pan. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan base. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper. Place 1 cup of blueberries (125g/4oz); vanilla; sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 7 minutes until blueberries breakdown. Mix cornflour and water; then stir in – it wil thicken quickly. Stir in remainig blueberries. Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. Will thicken as it cools. Once cool; stir. Adjust thickness 1/2 teaspoon of water at a time to make it the perfect "oozing" consistency (see video; Note 7) – be careful; don't make it runny! Spoon onto cheesecake so it's completely covered – you'll have maybe 1/2 cup sauce left; good for touch ups. Refrigerate 2 hours+. Slice and serve! 
https://www.recipetineats.com/best-no-mayo-coleslaw/, Dressing: Shake Dressing ingredients in a jar. Toss! Place cabbage; fennel; apple and dill in a very large bowl. Pour over Dressing; toss well. Sprinkle with caraway seeds then toss again. Set aside for at least 1 hour to allow cabbage to wilt. Give it a good toss; then transfer to serving bowl and serve! Storage: Keeps perfecty for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. Dressing stops apple from going brown. Best to bring to room temperature before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-broccolini-with-tahini-sauce-ottolenghi-recipe/, Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Sauce: Mix Tahini Sauce ingredients until combined. It should be loose enough so it can be drizzled; but not too runny. Set aside 15 minutes. Toss broccolini: Pile broccolini on tray; drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt; pepper and garlic. Roast for 12 – 15 minutes until the broccolini floret ends are dark brown and crunchy (the best part!); and the broccolini stem is just tender. (But if you want it really soft; lower temp to 180C/350F and cook 20 min). Plate up: Transfer to serving plate; allow to cool until warm. Drizzle over tahini sauce; sprinkle with almonds or pine nuts and serve! Excellent served warm OR at room temp. The Tahini Sauce goes brilliantly with other roasted vegetables too; including: carrots; cauliflower; broccoli; green beans and asparagus.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pasta-with-creamy-zucchini-sauce/, Bring a large pot of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook pasta per packet directions MINUS 2 minutes (yes; 2 whole minutes!) – pasta should be a bit too firm in the middle. Scoop out a big mug of pasta cook water; set aside (for sauce loosening; just in case); then drain. Melt butter in a large skillet or pot over medium high heat. Garlic and onion: Add garlic and onion; cook for 1 1/2 minutes until onion is slightly golden. Cook Zucchini: Add zucchini; cook for 1 minute. Then add salt and pepper; then stir for 2 minutes until it reduces in volume by about 1/2. Add liquids: Stir in cream; chicken stock; parmesan and corn. Bring to simmer; then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 3 minutes. It will still seem watery because water comes out of the zucchini – don't worry; it cooks down in the next step. Toss! Add pasta; then use two wooden spoons to toss well for 2 minutes; or until sauce reduces and is coating the pasta instead of pooling in the skillet. If it gets too thick; add a splash of reserved pasta cooking water. Pasta will finish cooking in this step. Serve: Remove from stove; serve immediately; garnished with extra parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/tomato-paste-replacement-for-canned-tomato/, Whisk together 1/4 cup water (65ml) with the flour until lump free. Then mix in remaining water; tomato paste and sugar. Use in recipes in place of canned tomato; add it at the time the recipe calls for canned tomato to be added. It will be watery while it's "raw"; but the flour will thicken the mixture as it cooks in things like bolognese; soup (like Minestrone); curries (like this Coconut Lentil Curry) and pasta bakes.  Pictures in post show the thickness after cooking on stove for 3 minutes on medium high – not necessary to do if added into a recipe then cooked.  There is no limit for how long it can be cooked for – you can use it for a quick recipe like this Bacon Pasta; or simmered for hours like in Ragu. Fridge storing – will keep for 5 days in the fridge.  Freezing – simmer 3 minutes on medium high; stirring regularly; until it thickens. Cool; freeze.
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-strawberry-cake/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Grease and line a 23 cm / 9" cake pan with baking paper/parchment paper. (Any type of cake pan is fine) For inside of cake: Dice some strawberries into ~1.5cm / 1" pieces to make 1 cup (about 1/3 of the strawberries) Topping: Cut the remaining strawberries in half. Place Wet ingredients in a bowl and whisk well for 1 minute. Add Dry ingredients then whisk well until lump free. Pour half into cake pan; smooth surface. Scatter over diced strawberries. Top with remaining batter. Smooth surface; then top with halved strawberries; cut face down. Bake 50 minutes or until skewer inserted into centre comes out clean. (Note 1) If you need to cook longer; cover with foil if it starts getting too golden. Stand 15 minutes in the cake pan before turning out onto cooling rack. Cool 15 minutes+ before serving warm or at room temp. Dust with icing sugar; and serve with cream or if serving warm; ice cream!
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-spinach-ricotta-rotolo/, Heat oil in a 25cm/10" ovenproof skillet over medium high heat. (Note 6) Add garlic and sauté for 10 seconds then add onion. Cook onion until translucent and starting to turn golden; then passata; water; chilli flakes (if using); salt and pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes on medium low; then stir through basil. Should be quite thin – the lasagna sheets will absorb water while in the oven so sauce thickens alot in oven. Scoop out 1 cup of the Tomato Sauce which will be used to drizzle over the dish at the end. Keep sauce warm. Preheat oven to 180°C/350CF (all oven types) Place Filling ingredients in a bowl. Mix well with wooden spoon. As per the photo & video; lay out the lasagne sheet with the shorter end in front of you. Place 1/3 cup (packed) of filling onto the lasagne sheet. Dab some water on the end furthest away from you (to seal the roll); then roll up starting from the end closest to you. Finish with the seal down. Cut rolls into 3 (so each piece is 3.5cm/1.5" wide). Place the rolls into the tomato sauce with the filling facing up. Repeat with remaining lasagna sheets until all the Filling is used up.  Drizzle the reserved Tomato Sauce over (don't cover completely; leave some exposed). Cover loosely with foil; bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven; remove foil. Drizzle with oil; top with mozzarella.  Bake 15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden and you've got some crunchy golden bits on the edges. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-broccoli-stir-fry/, Tenderise chicken: Consider tenderising chicken breast using this method. (Not needed for thigh) Broccoli: steam or boil using preferred method until cooked to your taste (it won't cook any further in the stir fry). I usually microwave steam 3 minutes on high. Drain well (waterlogged florets = diluted sauce). Sauce: Mix cornflour and soy sauce until lump free; then mix in remaining ingredients. Cook aromatics: Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion; stir for 10 seconds until garlic starts to go golden. Cook chicken: Add chicken and cook for 2 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked through. Thicken sauce: Add broccoli; Sauce and water. Stir well and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the Sauce thickens and becomes glossy; and coats the ingredients.  Serve over rice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/doner-kebab-meat-recipe-beef-or-lamb/, Mix beef or lamb with all the Spices – mix well using your hands. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours minimum; or up to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 170°C/ 325°F (150°C fan). Line baking pan with foil. Check to ensure skewers are long enough to prop on the sides of the pan. (Note 5) Place onion; bacon and garlic in a 8 cup/2L+  food processor. Blitz until it becomes a paste (video at 29 sec);~30 sec on high; scraping down sides as you go. Add meat and blitz on low until it becomes a paste (video at 42 sec); scraping down sides (~1 min for powerful food processors; 2 min for less powerful). (Note 4) Turn meat out onto work surface. Wet hands with water; then shape into an even block 20cm/8″ long. Place 2 x 60cm / 2 feet long pieces of foil overlapping each other by 1/3. (Note 6) Place meat on the end of the foil; then roll it up; tightly wrapping it in the foil. Twist the ends firmly to form a log 25cm/10″ long; then snip off excess foil. Roll into even log. Thread skewers through the log.  Place log elevated in pan by propping skewers on the edge of the pan. (Note 7) Cook for 1 1/2 hours; turning once after 1 hour; until the log reaches 70°C/160°F (up to 80°C/175°F is fine). The log is cooked at this point. (Note 9) Remove foil from log but leave skewers in place. Increase oven heat to 250°C/480°F; or as high as your oven can go if it can’t reach this. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes; rotating once; until browned all over. Remove skewers then stand the meat upright. Shave meat thinly – carve as much as you intend to use. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook shaved meat lightly coloured but still "floppy" (not crisped). Use immediately for Doner Kebabs! Smear hummus on warmed flatbread.

Grease 2 or 3 rings with butter (approx 9 cm / 3.5" wide; though any ring or metal shaper will do; Note 3) (TIP: Non stick rings – brush with melted butter. Everything else – smear with butter) Brush non stick skillet lightly with melted butter then place rings in the skillet. Turn stove on medium high (medium for strong stoves) and bring to heat (Note 4 for “sizzle test”). Pour 1/4 cup batter into the rings (65ml); about 1cm / 2/5" deep (will rise ~60%). Cook for 1 1/2 minutes – bubbles should start appearing on the surface (but not popping yet). Turn heat down to medium; cook for 1 minute – some bubbles should pop around the edges. Turn heat down to medium low; cook for a further 2 1/2 to 4 minutes; until the surface is "set" and it's clear there will be no more bubbles popping! (At this stage you can help the final bubbles pop with a skewer!) Remove rings (you might need to run knife around to loosen).  Then flip and cook the other side for 20 to 30 seconds for a blush of colour. Transfer to write rack (golden side down) and fully cool. Can be eaten once cool; but it’s even better the next day (Note 5). Toast in a toaster until the base is crispy.

Simmer 1 – Bring it to a simmer then adjust heat so it's simmering fairly gently (not super rapidly; will burn rice). Simmer for 10 minutes – no stirring! At this stage; a bit of rice should be poking through to the surface but there should still be plenty of liquid. Add peas; prawns and mussels – Scatter over peas; squidge the prawns and mussels into the rice (partial submerge is fine).  Simmer 2 – Cook for 8 minutes (turn prawns halfway if you think it's necessary) or until prawns are opaque; mussels are open; and most of the liquid has been absorbed but still a bit liquidy. Discard any mussels that do not open. Remove from stove.  Check rice – Do a taste test to see if the rice is cooked – it should be firm but cooked. If it is too firm for your taste; no stress; just add a splash of hot water (not too much!) and keep cooking.  Rest – Scatter over squid and reserved chorizo (residual heat will warm through); cover with lid then rest for 5 minutes (rice will absorb remainig liquid). Paella rice should now be tender but "juicy"; not stodgy and thick (if it is; add splash of water to loosen it). Garnish – scatter with parsley and wedges of lemon. Take to table as is; then mix up rice with seafood before serving!

After 30 seconds or so; start adding some folding action too. Cook for 60 seconds in total until you have a pile of soft; custardy scrambled egg folds ("curds") and no raw egg leaking on the edges of the pile. Take it off the stove when it's still a bit undercooked for your taste. Gently push /fold the eggs for another 10 seconds – it will finish cooking with residual pan heat – then slide onto hot toasted crusty bread slathered with butter.

https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-steak-marinade/, Mix together mustard; garlic and onion powder. Then mix in remaining ingredients. Place beef in a ziplock bag with Marinade and marinade overnight (12 – 24 hours). Remove from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature – key for even cooking of steaks. Shake off excess marinade. Brush BBQ Grills with oil; then heat on high heat until is really hot – you should see wisps of smoke. Or heat a heavy based skillet on high until very hot; then add oil – it will heat almost instantly. Add steaks. For 2cm / 3/4" thick steaks; cook the first side for 2 minutes; then turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes (medium rare 52°C/125°F; chart below for other doneness temps). (Note 3) Remove from skillet onto a WARM plate; cover loosely with foil and set aside for 5 minutes. Serve! I couldn't resist garlic butter – see recipe in notes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/no-yeast-pizza-dough/, Preheat oven to 250°C / 480°F (230°C fan) (Note 4.) Place shelf in the top quarter of the oven. Spray pizza pan or baking tray lightly with oil. Prepare pizza sauce and toppings. Keep shredded mozzarella in the fridge (Note 5). Using the standard S blade; add Dry Ingredients and pulse twice. Add water and olive oil. Blitz on low for 40 seconds – it will come together into a shaggy ball (video 33 sec). Sprinkle work surface with half Extra Flour; scrape dough out. Sprinkle with remaining Extra Flour and firmly shape into a ball. Place Dry ingredients in a bowl; mix to combine with a rubber spatula. Add water and olive oil; mix until flour is incorporated as best you can. Sprinkle work surface with half Extra Flour; dip dough out. Sprinkle with remaining Extra Flour then knead for 3 to 4 minutes until it's pretty smooth (video 38 sec); using more flour only if needed. Dough should be soft and elastic; and not stick to your hands.  It will not be completely smooth like yeast dough (video 38 sec)(Note 6). Shape dough into a ball. Roll out into a 30cm/12" round.  Transfer to pizza pan; preferably with holes (for crispier base); or a baking tray (Note 7 pizza stone). Use your fingers to pull from the centre to fill the pan to the edge – avoid pinching the edges (to ensure puffy crust!). Top with 1/4 cup pizza sauce and toppings of choice. Brush the crust edge (just exposed edge with no toppings on it) with oil. Bake 12 minutes; until the edges are crispy and golden. Cut and serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-noodle-soup/, Place Broth ingredients in a saucepan over high heat. Place lid on; bring to simmer then reduce to medium and simmer for 8 – 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. Meanwhile; cook noodles according to packet directions. Cut bok choys in half (for small / medium) or quarter (for large). Wash thoroughly. Either cook the bok choi in the broth in the soup broth OR noodle cooking water for 1 min (if noodles required boiling). Pick garlic and ginger out of soup.  Place noodles in bowls. Top with chicken and bok choy. Ladle over soup; garnish with green onions. Great served with chilli paste or fresh chillis.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-corn-fritters/, Preheat oven to 120°C / 250°F and set a wire rack on a baking tray. Place flour; cornflour and baking soda in a bowl; mix to combine. Add egg and milk; mix until incorporated (batter will be lumpy and thick). Add corn; parmesan; green onions and coriander. Mix until all the corn is evenly coated in batter. Add enough oil into the skillet so it just covers the base. Heat over medium high heat.  Spray the underside of a spatula with oil (so batter won’t stick when you flatten). Place 1/4 cup batter into skillet (ice cream scooper with lever is handy); then flatten to 1cm thick. Repeat with 2 or 3 more; but don’t crowd the skillet. Cook 3 minutes until deep golden and crisp; then flip and cook the other side for 2 – 3 minutes. Transfer to rack and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining fritters; using more oil as necessary. Serve with sauce of choice for dunking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-chicken-gyros-with-tzatziki/, Place the Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag and massage to mix. Add the chicken into the ziplock bag and massage to cover all the chicken in the Marinade. Marinate for at least 2 hours; preferably 3 hours; ideally 12 hours and no longer than 24 hours. Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise. Use a teaspoon to scrape the watery seeds out. Coarsely grate the cucumber using a box grater. Then wrap in paper towels or a tea towel and squeeze to remove excess liquid. Place cucumber in a bowl. Add remaining ingredients then mix to combine. Set aside for at least 20 minutes for the flavours to meld. Combine ingredients in a bowl. Brush the outdoor grill with oil; then preheat on medium high. Or heat 1 tbsp of oil in a fry pan over medium high heat. Remove chicken from Marinade. Cook the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes on each side; until golden brown and cooked through (cooking time depends on size of chicken). Remove the chicken from the grill / fry pan onto a plate. Cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. If your chicken thighs are large; you may need to cut them. Mine were small. Get a pita bread or flatbread (preferably warmed) and place it on a piece of parchment (baking) paper (or you could use foil). Place some Salad down the middle of the bread; then top with chicken and Tzatziki. Roll the wrap up; enclosing it with the parchment paper. Twist the end with the excess parchment paper to secure it and cut if desired. I prefer to lay everything out on a table and let everyone help themselves.
https://www.recipetineats.com/meatloaf-recipe/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Oil or spray a loaf tin. (Note 3) Glaze: Mix together in a small bowl. Set aside. Meatloaf: Place breadcrumbs in a very large bowl. Grate over onion. Mix so the breadcrumbs are all wet. (Note 4) Add remaining ingredients. Mix well using your hands. Form into a loaf shape; pinching together then smoothing over creases and cracks (helps prevent cracks during baking). Transfer into loaf tin. Brush generously with glaze; using about 1/2. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with most of the remaining glaze. If there is excess fat pooling; scoop/pour it off. Bake for a further 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Stand for 10 minutes before turning out and cutting into thick slices. You will probably get a bit of crumbling just on the edges of the first couple of slices; this is normal and indicative of the tenderness of the meatloaf (zero crumble indicates firm packed harder meatloaf which isn’t as enjoyable!). Ideal served with a dollop of ketchup; creamy mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-cucumber-salad-lemon-yogurt-dressing/, Dressing: Mix ingredients then leave for 20 minutes for the flavours to develop. Cucumber: Cut cucumber in half lengthwise; then slice into 3mm / 1/8" thick slices. Toss: Place cucumber; onion and mint in a bowl. Pour over Dressing and toss; then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cinnamon-apple-teacake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Grease a 20cm / 8″ springform pan with butter; then line with baking paper (parchment paper). Chop half the apples into 1.25 cm / 1/2" pieces. Slice the other half into 3mm / 1/8" thick slices. Place into separate bowls. Sprinkle/drizzle each bowl with half the butter; sugar and cinnamon. Toss to coat; set aside. Whisk Dry ingredients in a large bowl. Pour Wet ingredients in a separate bowl in the order listed. Whisk well to combine. Pour Wet into the Dry ingredients bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until flour is incorporated. Add chopped apple. Gently mix through until JUST dispersed (to keep cinnamon on apple; not dispersed through batter). Scrape into cake pan; smooth surface. Top with sliced apples – fan them out in a circle; overlapping each other by 1/4 (fiddle away to use up all the apple / make it even!). Bake 50 minutes; or until skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean (Note 3). Cover loosely with foil if you have to bake beyond 50 min (to stop apples burning). Place on cooling rack; release sides of springform pan. Heat Glaze: Place jam and water in a small bowl; microwave 20 seconds to warm; then mix. Glaze: Brush apples on surface with glaze. Cool: Allow to cool at least 30 minutes before cutting with sharp knife. It is sheer perfection when it's still slightly warm in the middle.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cottage-pie/, Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Then add carrots and celery.

Bring to simmer; then turn down heat so it is simmering rapidly – I have it on medium high. Cook for 30 minutes; stirring occasionally; until it reduces down to a gravy consistency (Note 1) (see video). Taste then add more salt if desired. Transfer to 6 cup pie dish (1.5 litre / quart). Cover; cool if you have time (even overnight). Cool filling = easier to top with mash (Note 2) Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Cook potatoes in boiling water for 15 minutes or until soft. Drain then return to pot on turned off stove. Shake briefly and allow to steam dry for 30 seconds or so (Note 3). Add butter and mash until melted; then add milk and salt. Mash until smooth. Spread onto pie; use a fork to rough up the surface (rougher surface = more golden bits). Sprinkle with paremsan; drizzle with butter (or skip this and just drizzle with olive oil) Bake for 25 – 30 minutes or until golden on top and bubbling on the edges. Stick a knife into the middle to ensure it is piping hot. Stand for 5 minutes before serving; garnished with fresh thyme leaves if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-caesar-salad/, Whizz all ingredients in food processor until smooth; starting with 3 tbsp milk.  Taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired; and use milk to get the dressing to the desired consistency. (Note 6) Set aside for 20 minutes+ to allow flavours to develop. Place bacon into a cold skillet (no oil); then turn onto medium high. Cook until golden; turn; cook other side until golden. Remove onto paper towels; cool; then chop. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.  Toast bread in the toaster for 1 minute (or oven for 2 minutes each side) until surface is dried but not browned.; Rub both sides of each piece of bread with the cut side of the garlic (Note 7). Remove crust from bread (optional) and cut into cubes – around 1.5 cups. Drizzle with 1 – 2 tbsp olive oil; sprinkle with salt; then bake until golden; shaking the tray once. Sandwich bread will take around 7 minutes; sourdough and similar breads take 12 – 15 min. Place lettuce in bowl with 1/2 the Dressing. Toss well; taste; then decide if you want more Dressing. Transfer to serving bowl. (Top with chicken and egg if using) Scatter over with bacon and croutons. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve! Eggs: Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Place over medium high heat and bring to simmer. Once the water is simmering; turn down to medium (gentle simmer) and cook for 3 min (for soft centres); 4 min for firm yolks and 6 min for hard boiled. Remove eggs; run under cold water for 15 sec then leave submerged in a bowl of cold tap water for 5 min. Peel then set aside. (Note 6) Chicken: Either pound the chicken to about 1.2cm/ 1/2" even thickness; or slice each breast in half horizontally. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Use bacon fat remaining in skillet. Cook first side for 5 min; turn then cook the other side for 2 min. Remove; cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 min. Cut into slices.
https://www.recipetineats.com/oven-baked-bbq-chicken/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F. Sauce: Mix all Sauce ingredients in a ceramic/glass baking dish (Note 3); then mix in water.

Skim off fat (optional): Tilt pan and spoon or drain off excess fat. Broil/grill – Change to broiler/grill on high. Spoon sauce over chicken generously; then place under grill / broiler for 2 to 3 minutes to caramelise the chicken and the sauce to thicken more. Do not walk away – this can happen quickly! Serve chicken; garnished with parsley or green onions; if using. Pictured in post with Mashed Potato and Green Bean Salad (minus feta). Cornbread; Coleslaw; Potato Salad (or try this no mayo Lemon Potato Salad); Southern Baked Beans; big leafy salad with classic Vinaigrette; steamed corn with butter; bread rolls; creamy mashed potato (or Creamy Cauliflower Mash for low carb emergency!); or Potato & Gravy.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-chicken-pho-soup-pho-ga/, Char onion & ginger – Heat oil in a 6 litre / 6 quart pot (Note 5) over high heat. Place ginger and onion facedown; leave undisturbed for 2 minutes until they blacken. Turn and leave for another 2 minutes. Put everything in pot – Add water and remaining Broth ingredients EXCEPT salt. Bring it a simmer; then lower heat so it's simmering VERY gently with the lid on; but open a crack (Note 6). Simmer gently 1.5 hours. Scoop off scum (dirty foam) that rises to surface once or twice during the simmering. Strain & measure – Remove chicken; then strain broth into a clean pot – you should have 1.5 litres / 1.5 quarts. If you have more; simmer to reduce. If less; top it up with water. Salt broth – Add salt; bring broth to a gentle simmer. Broth should be slightly on the salty side – it dilutes when you add the noodles.  Keep broth warm until ready to serve Shred chicken meat; discard bones and skin. (Note 6 Leftover Chicken ideas) Place Toppings out on the table. Reheat chicken (can briefly dunk in broth!). Prepare noodles per packet directions; just prior to serving. Drain very well (excess water dilutes broth). Place noodle in bowls. Top with chicken; ladle over 375ml / 1.5 cups broth. Sprinkle with green onion. Pile on Toppings of choice; add a squeeze of lime into the broth. Consume immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/swedish-meatballs/, Grate onion using a standard box grater (see video). Scrape onion and juices into bowl. Add bread and mix well – onion juice should make bread soggy (if not; add a tiny splash of milk). Set aside to soak for 1 minute. Add remaining Meatball ingredients EXCEPT oil. Mix well. Using a tablespoon measure and measure out a heaped tablespoon (or use ice cream scooper which is what I do); dollop on work surface. Repeat with remaining mixture: 25 – 30 meatballs. Then roll into shape. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add half the meatballs and brown all over (but raw inside still) – about 3 minutes. Remove onto plate; then brown the remaining batch. If there is lots of oil; pour off excess and discard. Lower heat to medium. Add butter into skillet and melt. Add flour and stir in. Cook for 1 minute. While mixing; add about 1/4 of the beef broth – it will thicken quickly. Then gradually add remaining beef broth; stirring as you go. Switch to whisk if required to make it lump free. When the liquid is simmering; add meatball and juices pooled on plate. Turn up heat slightly to keep it at a rapid simmer. Cook for 8 – 10 minutes or until the liquid thickens into a thin gravy; stirring occasionally. Add cream; simmer for a further 2 minutes then remove from stove.  Serve over mashed potato (or Cauliflower Mash for low carb). For a truly authentic experience; add a dollop of ligonberry jam on the side!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-baked-beans-recipe-heinz/, No need to do these steps if using canned beans; start with Step 1 under "Baked Beans" below. Soak beans in a big bowl of water for 8 – 24 hrs; then drain. Skim foam – Place beans in a large pot of water over high heat. Bring to a simmer; then skim off foam.  Simmer Reduce heat so it's simmering gently (medium or medium low). Partially cover with lid (leaving a crack for steam to escape); then cook for 1 – 1.5 hrs until just tender. (Start checking at 45 min). Beans should be still slightly firm on inside (they're cooked more in the sauce). Drain; use per recipe. Mix – Place all Baked Beans ingredients in a pot (except beans) and stir; then add beans. Simmer – Bring to a simmer; then lower heat to medium low and simmer for 20 minutes; without the lid. Stir every now and then so the beans don't catch on the bottom of the pot. Mix cornflour with water. Pour into pot while stirring; then cook for 2 minutes until sauce thickens – it will thicken quickly. (Note 3) Check for salt: Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve it the traditional way – piled over hot buttered toast. Or ladle into bowls; eat with a spoon and dunk in hot crusty bread!

https://www.recipetineats.com/sandwich-bread-without-yeast-quick-easy/, Preheat oven to 220°C/430°F (200°C fan). Grease a 22 x 13 cm / 9 x 5" loaf pan; then line with parchment/baking paper with overhang (to lift out). Mix dry: Place flour; baking powder; salt and sugar in a bowl; mix to combine. Add wet: Make a well in the centre; pour in oil and milk. Mix until flour is fully incorporated – batter will be thick but stirrable. Fill pan: Scrape into loaf pan; using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean and smooth the surface. Bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven; cover with foil. Return to oven. Turn oven DOWN to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan); bake 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Cool in pan 5 minutes; then use excess paper to lift out and transfer to cooling rack.  Cool completely before slicing – 45 minutes+. It IS more delicate than yeast breads (can't change science!) but slices far better than the usual "cake like" no yeast breads. Slices perfectly on Day 2 and beyond. Use for sandwiches; toast; grilled cheese; french toast; bread and butter pudding – anything you use "real" sandwich bread for!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pizza-dough-recipe/, Mix dry: Place flour; yeast; sugar and salt in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon. Add wet: Make a well in the centre. Pour in oil and water. Mix to bring together so it comes away from the side of the bowl. Knead 5 minutes: Sprinkle work surface with 1/2 the Extra Flour. Scrape dough out of bowl. Bring together into a ball then knead for 5 minutes until pretty smooth (see video for Before v After; Note 5). Shape dough into a ball. Drizzle large bowl with Extra Olive Oil (can use same bowl). Place dough in; turn over and rub top with oil. Cover with cling wrap; then put in a warm place for 1 – 2 hours until it doubles in size. (Rise #1) After rising; refrigerate bowl with dough for up to 5 days (do not punch down). Flavour gets better with time. (Note 7) Scrape dough out of bowl on work surface lightly dusted with flour. Shape into log; fully deflating dough in the process. Cut into 3 equal portions (330g / 11.6 oz each) – one for each pizza base. For each dough portion; shape into a ball; tuck the sides under; money-bag style; so you have a smooth surface. Place balls; smooth side up; on a large tray – 5cm / 2" from edge of tray; 10cm / 4" from each other. Sprinkle balls with a touch of flour and lightly rub to coat surface (so they don't stick to tea towel). Cover balls with lightly damp tea towel. Alternatively; cover loosely with a sheet of baking paper then seal tray with cling wrap; ensuring the dough balls have plenty of space to rise under the cling wrap. Leave in warm place 1 hour until almost double in size. (If fridge-cold; this will take 3 – 4 hours). Preheat oven to 275°C / 530°F; or as high as it will go. Put shelf in top third of oven. Sprinkle work surface with 1/2 tbsp flour. Place one dough ball on top. Without touching the edges; use finger tips and back of fingers to deflate dough gently and spread out into a 20cm/8" round. Then use your fingers and palms to stretch the dough; working around the circle; until it's almost the size of a 30cm / 12" pizza pan. Drag onto the pizza pan (or paddle if cooking on pizza stone; Note 8). Then finish stretching it to fill the pan. Neaten up the shape so it's as perfectly round and uniform as possible – the shape you have now is the shape it will bake to! Leave 1 cm / 1/3" of the edge untouched as much as possible (for puffy crusts!).  Spread with 1/4 cup pizza sauce; 130g / 1 1/3 cups freshly grated mozzarella; then toppings of choice (see Topping recipes here). Bake 10 minutes; rotating at 4 minutes and checking at 8 minutes; until cheese is melted and has some golden spots. Cut into wedges; serve immediately!! Repeat process for remaining balls to make two more pizzas.  Fit food processor with dough blade; if you have one. Place flour; yeast; sugar and salt in large food processor (8 cups/2L+). Pulse twice. With motor on low; pour oil in quickly. Then pour water in slowly over 10 seconds. Continue blitzing for 30 seconds – dough will come together; but won’t be a neat ball (that’s ok). Take dough out and shape into a ball. Follow recipe above for Rise #1; shaping; cooking etc – this dough is exactly the same as the above dough.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pizza-toppings/, Preheat oven to 275°C/530°F; or as high as it will go. Place oven shelf in top third of oven. Stretch dough to form pizza base and slide onto baking pan. Follow topping directions below; then place in oven. Turn pizza at 4 minutes so it cooks evenly; and check at 8 minutes (even if recipe says 10 minutes). Take out early if cheese gets too brown. Spread pizza sauce over base; followed by cheese. Distribute pepperoni over pizza; and bake. Spread pizza sauce over base; followed by cheese. Scatter remaining ingredients over pizza; and bake. Spread pizza sauce over base; followed by cheese. Scatter remaining ingredients over pizza; and bake. Spread barbecue sauce over base; followed by cheese. Scatter remaining ingredients over pizza; and bake. Toss prawns/shrimp with salt. Heat butter over medium heat in a skillet or heavy frying pan until frothing. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Cook prawns for 1 minute on one side until just starting to brown. Flip prawns; cook 1 minute more and remove. Reserve garlic butter. Spread pizza sauce over base; followed by cheese. Scatter remaining ingredients except rocket over pizza; top with prawns. Bake until done. Drizzle reserved garlic butter over prawns and scatter with rocket. Spread pizza sauce over base; followed by cheese. Scatter remaining ingredients over pizza; and bake. (Note 2) Spread pizza sauce over base. Drizzle 1 tbsp of oil over base; and bake. After 5 minutes; remove pizza from oven. Tear buffalo mozzarella into 10 pieces and distribute over pizza. Continue baking until pizza is done. Drizzle with remaining olive oil; and scatter with basil leaves. See recipe directions in the separate recipe here. Spread mozzarella cheese over base. Scatter provolone; parmesan and finally blue cheese over pizza. Bake. Spread pizza sauce over base; followed by cheese. Drizzle 1 tbsp oil over pizza and bake. 2 minutes before the pizza is done; remove from oven. Drape prosciutto casually around the pizza. Continue baking until done. Scatter rocket over pizza and drizzle with a little more olive oil. See recipe directions in the separate recipe here. Spread mozzarella cheese over base. Arrange potato slices over pizza; each slice overlapping no more than 1/3 so it will cook through properly. Sprinkle over the rosemary and salt; and drizzle with the olive oil. Bake for the standard cooking time given. Check with a fork or skewer that the potato is tender. If not fully cooked; cook another 2 minutes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pizza-sauce-recipe/, Combine ingredients and mix well. Combine ingredients and mix well Heat oil in a heavy-based; medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; and sautee until onions are soft but not coloured. Add tomatoes; oregano; salt and sugar. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low; and cook; stirring occasionally; until reduced by half (about 1 hour). You will need to stir more frequently towards the end to stop the sauce catching Leave to cool before using. Use 1/4 cup of pizza sauce for each pizza (30cm/12" wide). Place raw pizza crust on a pizza pan (preferably with holes). Spread sauce evenly using the back of a spoon; leaving a 1cm / 1/2" border for the crust. Cover with toppings of choice (less is more!). Standard pizza – sprinkle with 130g / 4.5 oz freshly shredded mozzarella cheese; then 1 cup toppings such as sliced pepperoni. (See this post for pizza topping recipes) Bake in preheated 275°C / 530°F oven on top shelf for 10 minutes; rotating at 4 minutes; until cheese has golden specks and crust is crisp. (See this homemade pizza recipe for full cooking directions; or this NO YEAST Pizza Dough recipe)
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-rice-paper-rolls-spring-rolls/, Peanut Sauce: Combine the Peanut Dipping Sauce ingredients. Mix briefly (it won’t come together); then microwave for 30 seconds. Mix again until smooth. Set aside to cool. Adjust sour with vinegar; salt with salt and spiciness to taste.  Thickness can be adjusted with milk or water once cooled. Place vermicelli noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water for 2 minutes; then drain (or follow packet instructions). Peel the prawns; slice in half lengthwise and devein (watch video). Remove the crunchy core of the lettuce leaves (watch video). Tip – LETTUCE BUNDLE (Note 4): Place some vermicelli noodles and bean sprouts in a lettuce leaf; then roll it up; finishing seam side down. Repeat. Fill a large bowl with warm water. The bowl doesn’t need to be large enough to fit the whole rice paper in one go. Place two rice papers together (if using 2). Note which side is the smooth side – this is supposed to be the outside of the spring roll. Submerge the rice papers into the water (both of them at the same time; together) for 2 seconds. If your bowl isn’t large enough to fit the whole rice paper in one go; that’s fine; just rotate it and count 2 seconds for each section you submerge into the water. Place both the rice papers (one on top of the other; they will stick together) on a board or the counter with the smooth side down. On the top part of the rice paper; place 3 prawns with a mint leaf in between; as per the photo below. Place the lettuce bundle with the seam side down onto the middle of the rice paper. Fold the left and right edges of the rice paper in; then starting from the bottom; roll up to cover the lettuce bundle. Then keep rolling firmly. The rice paper is sticky; it will seal itself. If you placed the ingredients on the rice paper as per the photo below; your rice paper rolls should look pretty with the prawn and mint leaves on the smooth side of the roll and the seam on the side or underside of the roll. Serve immediately with the peanut dipping sauce.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pupcakes-easy-dog-cupcakes-with-frosting/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Line a 12 hole muffin tin with cupcake liners.

https://www.recipetineats.com/anzac-biscuits-golden-oatmeal-cookies/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan forced) Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. Mix dry: Mix flour; oats; coconut and sugar in a bowl.   Melt butter and  golden syrup: Place butter and golden syrup in a saucepan over medium high heat and stir until butter has melted. Baking soda: Add baking soda and stir to combine – it will fizz up; this is normal. Immediately remove from heat. Biscuit dough – Pour butter mixture into flour and mix until just combined. The mixture will be crumbly but should stick when you press together. Form patties – Scrunch / press 1 tablespoon of the mixture into balls; then flatten into patties. (Thinner = crisper; thicker = chewier centre; crispy edges) Place balls; 2.5 cm/1" apart; on prepared trays. Bake for 15 minutes; swapping trays halfway during cooking; or until deep golden. (Bake 12 min for chewy biscuits!) Cool to crisp – Stand on trays for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool – they harden as they cool!
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-tomato-bean-soup/, Melt butter in a pot over medium high heat. Cook garlic; onion and carrot for 5 minutes until carrot is soft and sweet.  About 3 minutes in; add the Italian herbs and cook with the onion (makes the herb flavour "bloom"). Turn heat up to high; add tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes to remove the “raw” flavour. Add white wine; cook for 3 minutes until the harsh “winey” smell is gone and mostly evaporates so you’re just left with tomato paste again. Add 1/2 cup of beans (to thicken soup); stock; parmesan; salt and pepper. Stir; low heat; cover and simmer 3 minutes; stirring every now and then. Use a stick blender to puree until smooth (or transfer to blender). Add remaining beans; simmer 3 minutes. Stir in spinach until wilted; then stir in cream if using. Add more salt and pepper if needed (note: canned beans are already salted). Serve with crusty bread for dunking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/classic-pumpkin-soup/, Cut the pumpkin into 3cm / 2.25" slices. Cut the skin off and scrape seeds out (video is helpful). Cut into 4cm / 1.5" chunks. Place the pumpkin; onion; garlic; broth and water in a pot – liquid won't quite cover all the pumpkin. Bring to a boil; uncovered; then reduce heat and let simmer rapidly until pumpkin is tender (check with butter knife) – about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend until smooth (Note 3 for blender). Season to taste with salt and pepper; stir through cream (never boil soup after adding cream; cream will split).  Ladle soup into bowls; drizzle over a bit of cream; sprinkle with pepper and parsley if desired. Serve with crusty bread!
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-roast-leg-of-lamb/, Preheat oven to 170°C/335°F (standard) or 150°C (fan). Place garlic; onion and rosemary in a metal roasting pan. Season lamb: Place lamb leg right side up in the pan. (Note 2) Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and rub it in. Turn lamb over and place it so it mostly sits on the garlic and onion. Sprinkle with more salt and pepper; rub it in. (Video helpful here) Add liquids and cover: Drizzle lamb with olive oil. Pour broth and water around the lamb – it won't cover it; that's ok; the lamb sinks into it. Cover with foil (don't use a lid; you want a bit of liquid to steam out). Slow roast: Place in the oven and roast for 4.5 hours. (See Notes for roasting time table) Check meat: Remove from the oven; remove foil. Turn lamb over. Check it to ensure the meat is tender enough to pry a bit off easily with a fork. If not; return; covered; to oven. Brown lamb: Return uncovered lamb to oven for a further 45 minutes or until well browned. Rest: Remove lamb; spoon over pan juices generously. Transfer to serving platter; cover loosely with foil while you make the gravy (stays warm for 1 – 1.5 hours). Skim fat: Use a large spoon to skim off and discard some of the fat from the surface of the liquid. Add flour: Place pan on the stove on medium high. When the liquid bubbles; add flour. Use a whisk to mix it in – this may take a few minutes as the liquid reduces. Add water: Once it looks like sludge (see video); whisk in 1/2 – 1 cup of water until it becomes a gravy consistency to your taste. Adjust salt and pepper to taste – I rarely add extra salt. Strain gravy into a bowl; pressing juices out of the onion etc. Pour gravy into jug. The meat is tender so you will only need tongs to tear the meat off. Serve with gravy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/salad-dressing/, Place Dressing ingredients and Optional Flavourings in a jar and shake well until mustard dissolves. Makes enough for a big leafy salad for 4 people (4 big handfuls of lettuce); or garden salad.

Add everything else: Add remaining ingredients and stir. Bring to simmer; then place lid on and adjust heat to low / medium low so it's simmering gently. Simmer: Simmer for 30 minutes; then remove lid and simmer for a further 10 minutes to reduce the sauce. {Note 2 for cook times of other lentils}  Lentils should be soft; sauce should be thickened and creamy. Too thick; add water. Too thin; simmer with lid off – thickens quickly. Coriander: Stir through half the coriander; then taste and add more salt if needed. Serve over basmati rice; sprinkled with more coriander and a dollop of yogurt. (Low carb option – cauliflower rice).
https://www.recipetineats.com/buttery-seasoned-rice/, Place all Rice ingredients in a large saucepan and give it a stir. Bring to simmer over medium high heat (edges bubbling; entire surface rippling); put the lid on and turn stove down to medium low (LOW for strong stoves). It should be simmering gently. Cook for 13 minutes – do not lift lid! Tilt pot then QUICKLY peek to ensure all water is absorbed. Remove from stove; stand 10 minutes with lid on. Add butter and fluff rice with a rubber spatula. Serve! Storage – please read Note 4. Rice cooker – Same ingredients; water and rice ratio. Pop it all in your rice cooker and cook per manufacturer directions; stir through butter at end.
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-pasta-bake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Pasta – Boil water with 1 tbsp salt. Add pasta; bring back up to boil then cook per packet directions MINUS 2 minutes. Should be just cooked; still slightly firm in middle. Drain; return to pot. Heat half butter & 1 tbsp oil in a large pot over high heat. Stir in garlic for 10 seconds; then cook your raw meat and vegetables with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Meat must be fully cooked – will not cook further in oven. Add remaining butter; melt. Mix in flour; then follow Creamy Sauce step 2 onwards. Start here if you have NO COOK Add Ins (like canned tuna): Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic and stir for 10 seconds; then stir in flour. While mixing; gradually pour in about 1/3 of the milk. Once the flour-butter mixture is incorporated into the milk; pour in remaining milk and mix. Add remaining milk; stock powder; parmesan; pepper and herbs (if using) and mix. When the milk starts to heat up; mix constantly to make sure the white sauce doesn’t catch on the base.  After 4 – 5 minutes; the sauce should be thick enough that you can draw a path across the back of a spoon (see video).  Return cooked pasta into pot. Mix with sauce and no-cook Add Ins. Spread in large casserole dish; top with cheese and bake 25 minutes until golden and bubbly. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-yeast-bread-recipe-no-knead/, Mix Dough: Mix flour; yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add water; then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable; but not runny like cake batter. Adjust with more water or flour if needed for right consistency (see video at 17 sec; Note 5).  Rise: Cover with cling wrap or plate; leave on counter for 2 – 3 hours until it doubles in volume; it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly (see video at 24 seconds). If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising; move it somewhere warmer (Note 6). Optional – refrigerate for flavour development (Note 9): At this stage; you can either bake immediately (move onto Step 5) or refrigerate for up to 3 days. Take chill out of refrigerated dough – if you refrigerated dough per above; leave the bowl on the counter for 45 – 60 minutes while the oven is preheating. Cold dough does not rise as well. Preheat oven (Note 7) – Put dutch oven in oven with lid on (26cm/10" or larger). Preheat to 230°C/450°F (220° fan) 30 minutes prior to baking. (Note 8 for no dutch oven) Shape dough: Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour; scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 tbsp flour. Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server; large knife; spatula); fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it; it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move. Transfer to paper: Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough; then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down; smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle; then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. Don't get too hung up about shape. In fact; lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits! Dough in pot: Remove piping hot dutch oven from oven. Use paper to place dough into pot; place lid on. Bake 30 minutes covered; then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy. Cool on rack for 10 minutes before slicing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lentil-soup/, Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add celery and carrot.

https://www.recipetineats.com/momofuku-bossam-korean-slow-cooked-pork/, Mix sugar and salt together. Pat pork dry. Coat pork in sugar salt mixture; getting it into all the crevices. Rub/pat well to adhere as best you can – discard excess salt unused/falls off (usually ~ 2-3 tbsp). Place in a glass dish (Note 13); cover loosely with cling wrap and refrigerated 24 – 36 hours (Note 11). Preheat oven to 150°C/300°F (all oven types) with rack in the middle of oven. Remove pork from fridge – surface will be wet. Either transfer pork to clean pan (metal; ceramic or glass) or drain off excess liquid / scrape out salt/sugar in same glass pan. Do not rinse pork. Roast 5 hours (Note 12); uncovered; spooning over pan juices once each hour; until you can easily pull the meat apart with 2 forks (check on side).  Remove from oven; rest for 10 minutes (up to 1 hour is fine; loosely cover in foil). Turn oven up to 260°C/500°F (all oven types). Mix brown sugar and salt. Spoon juices all over pork. Spoon sugar onto pork and use your hands to make it stick to the top and sides (not underneath). Make layer on top as even as you can (for even caramelisation). Place in oven for 10 minutes until surface is a deep golden crust; sugar is bubbling and caramelised (see VIDEO!). Keep a close eye on it from 5 minutes. If the highest points start getting black; cover with small piece of foil (just stick it on). Remove from oven and transfer to serving platter for serving. (Don’t use pan juices; it will be salty from brine) Ginger Shallot Sauce: Mix ingredients in bowl and stand for 20 minutes to let it soften. Ssam Sauce: Mix ingredients together. Oil will naturally separate over time if sauce is left to stand; just mix again to reincorporate. Place pork on serving platter with lettuce; oysters; kimchi; rice; Ginger Shallot Sauce and Ssam Sauce on the side. Attack the pork – it will shred easily. Shred as much or little as you want; let people do it themselves or you can do it for them. Prepare to fight over the epic crust. To eat; place lettuce in hand. Spoon in some rice; top with pulled pork; small piece of kimchi; oyster; some ginger shallot sauce then finally a little drizzle of spicy Ssam sauce. Bundle up; bite and enjoy!

Remove bay leaves. Use a stick blender to blitz 2 or 3 times – thickens soup but doesn’t make it completely smooth (my preference; you can blend completely if you want). Return ham into slow cooker; stir. Taste and add more salt if needed (soup gets lots of salt from ham). Serve garnished with parsley. Serve with crusty bread for dunking – make a quick Irish Soda Bread; Garlic Bread or upgrade to Cheesy Garlic Bread!

Cooking order: Start with thighs and drumsticks; wings next and cook breast last. (Note 6). Squidge a piece of chicken in remaining marinade; place in flour. Coat well; pressing very firmly to adhere. Transfer to plate. Coat 2 or 3 more pieces – just for one cooking batch; covering oil surface in single layer. (Note 7) Carefully place chicken in oil – it will bubble energetically but it will not spit. Once chicken is in; oil temperature should drop to 150°C/300°C – adjust heat to target this. DO NOT TOUCH chicken for 2 minutes – to let the crust bond with the chicken skin. After this; you can move them around but oil should be deep enough that you do not need to flip (but you can if you want!). Thighs and drumsticks – cook for 8 minutes (wings for 5 minutes); or until deep golden brown and internal temperature at thickest part is 75°C / 167°F. Breast – fry for 6 minutes or until internal temperature at thickest part is 65°C / 150°F (time depends on size). Place onto rack and keep warm in oven.

Stove – Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in large skillet over medium high heat. Optional: Cook 2 minced garlic cloves 20 sec until golden. Add rice; cook 4 to 5 minutes; stirring every minute or so; for 5 minutes until just cooked.  Serve in place of rice with stir fries; curries; anything saucy that you like serving with rice. Use in place of rice or grains in salads and fried rice.
https://www.recipetineats.com/icing-for-biscuits/, Place Icing ingredients in a large bowl; starting with 1 tablespoon water; and beat for 1 minute on speed 5 until smooth and glossy (start on low then speed up). Divide icing into different bowls for colouring. Add food dye and mix – keep adding colouring until you achieve the colour you are after. If icing gets too thin; add more icing sugar.  Icing consistency test: Should be able to draw a figure 8 on the surface and you can see if for 2 seconds before sinking in and disappearing. Should be thick enough to pipe details but thin enough to spread smoothly on surface of cookie. ADJUST icing – thinner with water (1/2 tsp at a time); thicker with more icing sugar. Transfer icing into disposable piping bags or ziplock bags. Snip the TINIEST bit off the corner. Smaller hole = better detail in icing. Remember: You can cut hole bigger; but not smaller! OR using very thin piping nozzle. Pipe decorations on cookies as desired. Decorate with sprinkles etc while wet (so they stick). Or dry completely before piping on details. To fill a large surface; use toothpick to spread. Place skewer on edge of frosting bowl. Hold edge of cookie with two fingers; then carefully dip face of cookie into frosting. Pull out of frosting then lightly scrape surface across skewer to remove excess. Decorate with sprinkles etc while wet (so they stick). Or dry completely before piping on details.

To keep fizz alive for longer; best to make this just prior to serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/celebration-salmon-salad/, Flake salmon: Use two forks to flake salmon into large chunks. Dressing: Mix the Yoghurt Ranch Dressing ingredients in a bowl. Adjust olive oil + lemon juice to taste. Leave 20 minutes. Pickle Onions: Place ingredients in a bowl; toss to coat. Set aside for 1 hour+ or until onion is softened (if in a rush; make sure the onion is finely sliced = faster pickle). Drain. Marinated Kale: Place kale in a large bowl; drizzle with oil then sprinkle with salt. Use your fingers to massage the oil onto the leaves – you want to ensure every part of the kale is coated in oil. Set aside for 30 minutes or until kale is softened. Nectarines/peaches option- halve then finely slice.  Grapefruit/blood orange option – segment per video. Squeeze all remaining juice out of the membrane after segmenting; mix into dressing. Place lettuce; kale; fennel; 1/2 cup onion in bowl. Drizzle with about 1 cup dressing and 1/3 cup parmesan. Toss well to coat. Taste; add more parmesan or salt if you want; or more dressing. Pile half dressed lettuce onto serving platter. Flake over half the salmon and half the fruit. Scatter with more red onion. Top with remaining lettuce; salmon; fruit and onion (might not use all onion).  Drizzle with some dressing (might not use all; serve remainder on side). Scatter over snow pea sprouts; sprinkle with remaining parmesan. Place on table and let everyone help themselves!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-baked-chicken-with-gravy/, Pat chicken skin dry with paper towels. Leave chicken in fridge overnight; uncovered; to dry skin out. Preheat oven to 240°C/ 465°F (220°C fan). Line tray with foil then baking / parchment paper; place rack on tray (Note 4) Mix Rub in a bowl. Pat chicken skin dry with paper towel. Drizzle with oil and rub all over; then sprinkle with Rub. Use hands to rub herbs all over the chicken; getting right into all the cracks and crevices. Place on rack. Thigh + drumsticks – Arrange thigh pieces skin side up; and for drumsticks the side with the most skin up. Butterflied/spatchcocked – Arrange breast side up with tail end of chicken pointed back towards back of oven; neck end closest to door. Thighs + drumsticks – roast for 35 minutes or until internal temperature is 75°C/165°F; or juices run clear when pierced in the middle. Butterflied/spatchcocked – roast for 45 minutes; or until internal temperature is: 66°C / 151°F for the breast AND 75°C/165°F when inserted into the joint between the leg and the thigh. Extra browning – if skin isn't browned/crispy enough; flick grill/broiler on high for 1 – 3 minutes. CAREFUL – browns super quick! Tent VERY loosely with foil (to preserve crispy skin) for 5 minutes. Scrape every bit of juice; fat and all the brown stuff off the tray into a saucepan. Turn stove onto medium. Once juices are bubbling; add flour and whisk to combine. Slowly pour in broth; whisking as you go. Add soy sauce or gravy browner and pepper. Continue stirring for 3 to 5 minutes – as it becomes steamy; gravy will thicken. Once it becomes a syrupy consistency (see video); remove from stove. Adjust salt to taste right at end; then pour into jug. Carve up the chicken as you would a roast chicken. Cut breast into 3 or 4 pieces. Cut thighs in half along the bone. Pile it all up onto a plate; garnish with parsley or other fresh herbs. Serve with gravy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-make-glazed-ham/, Take ham out of fridge 1 hour prior. Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (140°C fan). Arrange shelf in lower third so the ham will be sitting in the centre of the oven (rather than in top half of oven). Make Glaze per recipe. Run small knife around bone handle; cutting through rind. Cut the rind down each side of the ham; from the cut face of the ham; down to the cut you jujst made around the handle of the bone. Run the knife between the fat and the skin on the cut face of the ham. Slide fingers under the rind on the cut face of the ham; and run them back and forth to loosen so you can get your fingers under. Start pulling back; while continuing to slide fingers back and forth. The rind comes of fairly easily. Use knife if needed to slice off any residual rind. Lightly cut 2.5cm / 1" diamonds across the fat surface of the ham; about 75% of the way into the fat. Avoid cutting into the meat. Insert a clove in the intersection of the cross of each diamond on the surface (optional). Place the ham in a large baking dish. Prop handle up on edge of pan + scrunched up foil so surface of the ham is level (more even browning). Brush / spoon half the glaze all over the surface and cut face of the ham (don't worry about underside; glaze drips down into pan) Pour the water in the baking dish; then place in the oven. Bake for 2 hrs; basting very generously every 30 minutes with remainig glaze + juices in pan; or until sticky and golden.  Use foil patches to protect bits that brown faster than others – press on lightly; caramelisation won't peel off with the foil. Allow to rest for at least 20 minutes before serving. Baste; baste; baste before serving – as the glaze in the pan cools; it thickens which means it "paints" the ham even better – but be sure to save pan juices for drizzling.  Sauce: Use pan juices as the sauce – it's loaded with flavour. Drizzle sparingly as the glaze flavour is intense! Note juices need to be warm for drizzling; it thickens when cooled. Thin slightly with water if required. Presentation: Wrap handle with baking paper and ribbon if desired. Remove cloves; if you used them. Cover serving platter with lots of green fluffage; then place ham on. Surround with quartered oranges or other fruit; for colour. Let people admire before carving! Serving: Personal preference whether to serve at room temp or warm; I like either. I also like to drizzle with pan juices – it looks messier but tastes fabulous. Slice thinly! I start slicing at the table; then finish it in the kitchen (towards end when it gets messy!) Leftovers: See list in post for recipe using leftover ham and ham bone!  Keeps for 1 week in the fridge in a ham bag or pillowcase. Soaking solution: Mix 1 litre / 1 quart of water with 2 tablespoons white vinegar. Soak ham bag or pillowcase for 15 minutes. Storing: Wring dry; place ham inside; seal loosely. Refrigerate.  Repeat ~3 days: When ham bag dries out (usually ~ 3 days); repeat soaking steps above. Freezing: Freezes for 3 months. Freeze in blocks then slice after thawing (recommended; ham is juicier). Wrap blocks in cling wrap then place in airtight container. Alternatively; slice and place in airtight container then freeze.
https://www.recipetineats.com/gougeres-french-cheese-puffs-finger-food/, Preheat the oven to 220°C / 425°F (200°C fan). Lightly grease 2 trays then line with parchment / baking paper. Place water; butter and salt in a saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil until butter is full melted. Remove from stove; add flour; salt; pepper and nutmeg. Mix until incorporated. Return to stove on LOW heat and mix for 1 minute (this dries the mixture out; see video for before/after). Remove from stove; leave for 2 minutes. Add 1 egg; mix vigorously until incorporated – batter splits at first; but it always comes together! Add 3 more eggs; one at a time; mixing until incorporated before adding the next. Good arm workout! (Or use electric beater) Stir in 2 cups cheese. Drop 1 tablespoon mounds onto trays (small cookie scoop is ideal; otherwise use a measuring tablespoon and a teaspoon to scrape out. Can make larger – good for dunking!) Brush with yolk; then top with a pinch of reserved Cheese for topping. Bake 25 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes so they become crusty and inside dries out a bit.  Serve warm as pre dinner nibbles; finger food at gatherings; or dunk into soups and stews!
https://www.recipetineats.com/kir-royale-french-champagne-cocktail/, Pour creme de cassis in a champagne glass; then top with Champagne and serve!

https://www.recipetineats.com/tuna-mornay-casserole-pasta-bake/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Crunchy Topping – Mix together. Cook pasta per packet directions MINUS 1 minute. Drain then allow to cool slightly; then return into pot. White Sauce – Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add flour and stir into melted butter. While whisking; gradually pour in about 1/3 of the milk. Once the flour-butter mixture is incorporated into the milk; pour in remaining milk and whisk. Add Vegeta; mustard; onion and garlic powder; whisk. When the milk starts to heat up; whisk constantly to make sure the white sauce doesn’t catch on the base. After 4 – 5 minutes; the sauce should be thick enough that you can draw a path across the back of a spoon (see video). Remove from stove and stir in parmesan. Assemble & Bake – Add tuna into pasta and flake into large chunks with fork (not too much; don't want it to turn to mush when stirred). Add corn; pour over sauce; then gently stir. Scrape into baking dish; top with Crunchy Topping. Bake 25 minutes until top is golden and edges are bubbling. Sprinkle with chives if desired then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-brine-recipe/, Pour about 1/3 of the water into a large pot (large enough for the brine and submerged chicken) with remaining Brine ingredients. Bring to boil boil 1 minute; stir to dissolve salt. Remove from heat; pour in remaining water. Cool completely before using (I cool about 30 min then refrigerate 1 1/2 hours). DO NOT put chicken in before full cool; this is a health hazard (Note 4). Flip chicken upside down (so legs and breast are on underside. Submerge chicken in brine; cover and refrigerate for 12 – 24 hours (Note 5). Don't worry if underside of chicken doesn't stay under water – the the breast side is; that is what matters. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry to remove excess moisture.  Tie legs with string (if desired); tuck wings under. Drizzle/brush with most of the butter all over; including underside (butter will firm up on contact).  Sprinkle with pepper and the TINIEST pinch of salt; place chicken on a rack in a heavy based roasting tray. Set aside for 20 minutes.  Preheat fan forced oven to 220°C/430°F.  Turn down the oven to 180°C/350°F; then roast chicken for 50 minutes to 1 hour (Note 7) or until the internal temperature at the joint between the leg and thigh is 75°C/165°F; or until juices run clear.  Check at 45 minutes; rotate the pan if not browning evenly; and brush top with remaining melted butter. Remove chicken from the roasting tray; cover loosely with foil and rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Chicken is so juicy; it needs little more than a tiny drizzle of the juices in the pan (go easy; it's salty). Otherwise; make a gravy while the chicken is resting – see Note 8.
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-herb-slow-cooker-turkey-breast/, Garlic Herb Butter: Mix ingredients together. Loosen skin (video helpful): Pat breast dry.

https://www.recipetineats.com/juicy-slow-cooker-turkey-breast/, Place Rub ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine; it should be a wet paste. Pat the turkey dry all over with paper towels. Slather with the Rub; using most for the side and top. Place the garlic; onion and thyme face down in the slow cooker. Place the turkey breast on top so it is elevated. Slow Cook on LOW for 6 hours (do not use high) or until internal temperature reads 165F/75C when thermometer is inserted into the middle. Check internal temperature at 5 hours if you can. (To roast; follow this recipe).  Remove turkey from the slow cooker (do not leave in slow cooker on Warm setting) and let it rest for 20 minutes before crisping the skin. Preheat gril/broiler to high. Place an oven shelf 30cm / 1 foot from the heat source. Remove turkey breast from the slow cooker into a heatproof serving dish. Place on the oven shelf and broil for 3 to 5 minutes until the skin is crispy. Keep an eye on it – it browns very quickly! Serve immediately with gravy on the side. Strain the liquid into a measuring jug; squishing the garlic etc to extract all the flavour. If you are short of 2 cups; top up with chicken broth (I usually get 2 cups of liquid from a 4 lb / 2 kg turkey breast). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and mix to combine. Pour about 1/2 cup of liquid into the flour mixture and mix until it forms a paste. Slowly add remaining liquid; stirring as your go. Use a whisk if required to make the gravy smooth. Simmer until thickened – take it off before it is as thick as you want because it will continue to thicken. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with turkey.

https://www.recipetineats.com/browned-butter-savoury-sweet-potato-casserole/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Place potatoes on a foil lined tray. Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes (small) to 1 hour 40 minutes (large) until knife can be easily inserted into the centre. Cool potatoes until they can be handled (but still piping hot inside!) or use tea towel to handle. Meanwhile; place butter in a large silver saucepan over medium heat. Once melted and starts to foam; add sage leaves. Cook 1 minute or until golden brown; then fish through the foam to find the leaves and drain on paper towels (will crisp when cool). Continue to leave butter on stove until foam dies down and you see black bits on the bottom of the pan (it will smell nutty). Strain through paper towel lined sieve – should have 180ml or so. Crumble sage leaves in your hand (chop if not fully crisp) and place in bowl. Add 1/4 cup Browned Butter; panko; parmesan; garlic; salt and pepper; mix. Cut slits down the middle of the potatoes then scoop flesh out into a bowl. Add 1/4 cup Browned Butter (below); sour cream; parmesan; salt and pepper.

Cool: Remove muffins from the muffin tin immediately onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature (warm is extra yum!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/pumpkin-pie/, If using homemade pie crust; blind bake it per the Pie Crust recipe and fill crust straight after removing from oven. If using store bought; blind baking is not necessary (but if you want to; follow the Pie Crust recipe). Preheat oven to 170°C / 335°F (150°C fan). Place pumpkin; sugar; salt and spices into a saucepan over medium heat. Once you see steam; cook; stirring regularly; for 5 minutes (this removes excess moisture and lets spices bloom). Remove from stove and scrape into a bowl. Add cream; whisk. Whisk eggs in one by one; mixing just enough to incorporate. If you whisk vigorously for ages; it will aerate the mixture; leading to cracks. Pour into Pie Crust; transfer to oven.  Bake 45 – 55 minutes or until the centre is set but still has a slight jiggle and the toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean but damp (if it still has pumpkin batter; keep cooking). (Note 2) Cool completely for 4 hours+ before cutting to serve. Serve with cream and dusting of cinnamon or nutmeg if desired!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pie-crust-recipe/, Pulse Dry: Place flour; sugar and salt in food processor. Pulse twice to combine. Cut in butter: Scatter butter across surface. Pulse 5 times until the largest pieces are the size of chickpeas. Add chilled water: With the motor running on low; pour 2.5 tbsp of water into the tube feeder. Form crumbs: Keep blitzing for 10 seconds until crumbs form (also see video). Pinch between fingers – they should stick and form a dough. HAND option: Whisk flour; sugar and salt in large bowl. Rub butter into flour with tips of fingers until it resembles crumbs – it should look the same as using a food processor. Then mix in cold water with rubber spatula; then proceed with steps below. Form disc: Tip crumbs out onto work surface; bring together into dome (don't knead); pat into 2cm/ 4/5" thick disc. Chill: Wrap in clingwrap then refrigerate 1 hour (up to 2 days; otherwise freeze). Dust with flour: Sprinkle work surface with flour; unwrap dough and place on the flour. Sprinkle top with flour; dust rolling pin with flour. Roll out: Roll out into round that's 10cm/4" larger than 22.5cm/9" pie tin. Patch up and roll over cracks as necessary Transfer to pie dish: Gently roll the pastry so it wraps around the rolling pin. Unroll it over the pie dish. Drape pastry into pie tin (do not stretch/pull; causes shrinkage). Trim: If making a pie with NO LID (like Pumpkin Pie); then trim edges with scissors leaving a 1 cm / 2/5" overhang. If making a pie with a lid (like a Meat Pie) then trim edges so they align with the edge of the pie tin (ie no excess overhang). Tuck excess under; if appliable (ie per step above; if making a no lid pie). Then crimp or decorate edge as desired.  Refrigerate: Put pie crust in the freezer for 15 – 30 minutes (while oven heats up). This helps prevent shrinkage; firms up the butter again (flakiness!) and helps to ensure decorative crimped edges remain in tact. Baking options (Note 4) – Blind bake the pie crust if it will be baked once filled (eg Meat Pie; Pumpkin Pie). Fully bake the pie crust if it will not be baked once filled. Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Line & weigh down: Place 2 large pieces of parchment/baking paper crosswise over the pastry; then fill with baking beads or lots of rice or dried beans to weigh it down. (Note 2) Bake 1 covered: Bake for 15 minutes; then remove from oven. Bake 2 uncovered: Use excess paper to CAREFULLY remove hot beads; then return to oven for 5 minutes or until base is light golden (doesn't need to be 100% cooked though). Cool: Remove from oven. Cool 15 minutes in the pie tin before filling (another measure to avoid soggy base). Follow directions per Blind Baking steps above BUT bake at 190°C/375°F (170°C fan) covered with baking beads for 25 minutes; then 15 minutes uncovered until golden. Fully cool before filling. Fill and bake per directions of chosen pie filling – such as Pumpkin Pie; Pecan Pie; Meat Pie. The par baked pastry will not be 100% cooked; it finishes cooking with the filling. It's cooked enough so the crust will not go soggy.
https://www.recipetineats.com/smashed-cucumber-salad/, Bash the cucumbers until they split open on the sides (see video) using something heavy like the smooth side of a meat mallet; rolling pin; pestle or even a can.

Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper; then immediately place in the skillet. Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 – 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust; then turn. Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute; then push steaks to one side and toss in butter; garlic and thyme. BE CAREFUL – the thyme will sputter! Baste: As soon as the butter is melted; continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it’s cooked to your liking – 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F; chart below for other doneness temps) Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more.

Use water as needed to loosen frosting to soft spreadable consistency (like human buttercream frosting!). Use while warm (it “sets” when it cools). Spread 1/4 frosting on one cake. Top with other cake. Frost tops and sides with remaining frosting; reserving some to pipe decorations if desired (3/4 cup frosting).
https://www.recipetineats.com/meat-pie-recipe/, Sprinkle beef with 1/2 tsp salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add 1/3 of the beef and brown aggressively all over; then remove. Repeat with remaining beef; adding more oil if needed. Turn stove down to medium high. Add garlic and onion; cook 3 minutes. Add flour; stir through. Slowly add beef stock while stirring constantly. Once flour is dissolved; add wine; tomato paste; Worcestershire; pepper and bay leaves. Return beef into pot; cover with lid; adjust heat so it’s simmering gently. Simmer 1 hr 45 minutes. Remove lid; increase heat slightly and simmer 30 – 45 minutes; stirring regularly; or until beef is fork tender and liquid reduces down to a thickish gravy; just about covering beef (see video). Do not reduce liquid too much – thickens more as it cools & in pie. Remove from stove; cover and cool filling (I usually leave overnight). Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Cut out 6 rounds from the shortcrust pastry; then drape pastry into pie tins – don’t stretch and pull pastry; causes shrinkage. (Notes 1 & 6)  Place pies on tray. Top each pie with large sheets of parchment / baking paper and fill with pie weights (Note 7). Bake 20 minutes; remove; then use paper overhang to carefully remove pie weights. Return crusts into oven for 5 minutes or until base is light golden and dry (can skip; Note 8). Remove from oven. Fill pies with cooled filling; push down to fill. Should be slightly mounded. Cut rounds from partially thawed puff pastry – cut them slightly larger than the edge of the cooked pastry bases. Brush edge of pie crusts with egg; then place lid on filling; pressing edges to seal puff pastry to the shortcrust pastry. Brush lids with egg; then cut a 1cm / 0.5″ incision in the middle using a small knife. Bake 30 minutes or until deep golden and puffed. Devour hot and fresh; topped with tomato sauce or ketchup if desired!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spinach-ricotta-pasta-bake/, Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Pasta Sauce: Pour out about 1/4 cup of the passata (to make room to add flavourings). Add the remaining Pasta Sauce ingredients into the bottle; screw the lid on and give it a shake. Cook pasta for time per packet MINUS 1 minute.  SCOOP OUT 1 mugful pasta cooking water; drain and set aside. Ricotta Mixture – Mix Ricotta Mixture ingredients in a very large bowl. Use a splash of pasta cooking water if needed to make it creamy. Add pasta and stir to combine. Transfer to a heatproof baking dish. Top with Pasta Sauce; top with cheese. Loosely cover with foil. Bake for 25 minutes; then remove the cover and bake for a further 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve while hot and fresh!
https://www.recipetineats.com/hot-cross-buns/, Mix dry – Place flour; yeast; sugar; all spice; cinnamon; and salt in a large bowl. Briefly mix with stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Add wet – Add butter; milk; egg; sultanas and zest. Standmixer: Mix for 5 minutes until a smooth elastic dough forms. Start on speed 2 then once the ingredients are combined; increase to speed 4. After 1 minute; add extra flour if required; just enough so dough comes away from side of bowl when mixing and doesn't stick terribly to your fingers. (Note 5).  Hand kneading: Alternatively; dust a work surface with flour and knead by hand for 10 minutes. Dough is kneaded enough when it's smooth and does not break when stretched – see photos & video for before/after comparison. Leave dough in the bowl; cover with cling wrap and place in a warm; wind free place to rise until doubled in size. This will take anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours depending on how warm it is – see Note 6. Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang. Remove cling wrap and punch dough to deflate. Dust work surface with flour; place dough on work surface; shape into a log – this will deflate the air. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Take one piece and press down with palm; then use your fingers to gather into a ball; then roll the dough briefly to form a ball. This stretches the dough on one side and that’s how I get a nice smooth surface. Place the ball with the smooth side up on the tray. Repeat with remaining dough. Line them up 3 x 4. Spray a piece of cling wrap lightly with oil (any); then loosely place over the tray. Return tray to warm place and leaver 30 – 45 minutes; until the dough has risen by about 75% (less than double in size). Partway through Rise #2; preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types). Mix flour and water until a thick runny paste forms – see video for thickness required. Spoon into a round 3 mm piping bag or small ziplock bag then snip corner. Remove the cling wrap and pipe crosses onto the buns. Go slow so it hugs the curves. Bake in preheated oven (180°C/350°F) for 22 minutes; or until the surface is a deep golden brown. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe. Meanwhile; place jam and water in a bowl; microwave for 30 seconds. Mix to combine. Remove buns from oven. Use overhang to lift buns onto a cooling rack.  Brush with jam mixture while warm. Allow to cool to warm before serving. Place the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a medium bowl; then pour in water. Leave for 5 minutes until it froths. Place flour; remaining sugar; salt and spices in a bowl. Whisk to combine. Make a well in the centre. Add remaining Buns ingredients and pour in the yeast liquid; including all froth. Mix until combined with wooden spoon – it will be like a thick muffin batter. Not pourable; but thick and sticky. Leave dough in the bowl; cover with a wet (clean) tea towel and place in a warm place to rise for around 1 1/2 – 2 hours. See Note 5 for how I do this (you will laugh – but it works every time!). The dough will triple in size and be bubbly on the surface. Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang. Remove tea towel and punch dough to deflate. Dust work surface with flour; place dough on work surface. Dust top of dough then knead lightly (to deflating air) and shape into a log. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Take one piece and press down with palm; then use your fingers to gather into a ball; then roll the dough briefly to form a ball. This stretches the dough on one side and that’s how I get a nice smooth surface. Place the ball with the smooth side up on the tray. Repeat with remaining dough. Line them up 3 x 4. Spray a piece of cling wrap lightly with oil (any); then place over the tray. Return tray to warm place and leave for 45 min – 1 hour; until the dough has risen by about 75% (less than double in size). Partway through Rise #2; preheat oven to 180C/350F (all oven types). Mix flour and water until a runny paste forms – see video for thickness required. Spoon into a round 3 mm piping bag or small ziplock bag then snip corner. Remove the cling wrap and pipe crosses onto the buns. Go slow so it hugs the curves. Bake for 22 minutes; or until the surface is a deep golden brown. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe. Meanwhile; place jam and water in a bowl; microwave for 30 seconds. Mix to combine. Remove buns from oven. Brush with jam mixture while warm. Use overhang to lift buns onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool to warm before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/easter-chocolate-cake/, Preheat oven to 180C°/350°F (160°C fan). Read Note 4 regarding shelf positions. Grease 2 x 22cm/9" cake pans with butter; then line the base. (Note 3 re: springform pans and other pan sizes). Sift flour; cocoa; baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl. Add Sugar and salt. Whisk briefly to combine. Add eggs; milk; oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free – about 30 seconds. Add boiling water and whisk to incorporate. The batter is VERY thin (see video). Pour batter into cake pans. Bake for 35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. See Note 4 regarding cook time if pans are on different shelves. Cool for 10 minutes; then turn out onto wire racks upside down (Note 5). Cool completely before frosting. I frosted the cake with my Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (scale recipe up by 50%).
https://www.recipetineats.com/salmon-quiche/, Homemade quiche crust or frozen shortcrust pastry – prepare and bake the crust per Quiche Crust recipe. Refrigerated pie crust – unroll; fit into a 9″ pie dish or tart tin. Bake per packet directions. Prepared pie shell (ie comes in foil dish) – bake per packet directions; scale Filling down to 4 eggs (Note 1). Preheat oven to 180C/350F (160C/320F fan forced). Place cooked quiche crust on a tray. Asparagus – break woody ends off (Note 7). Cut into 3.5cm / 1.5″ pieces; separate tips from stems (tips for decorating). Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and garlic; saute for 2 minutes or until leeks are translucent; don’t let them go golden. Stir in asparagus stems (don’t cook); then remove from stove. Cool slightly then scatter across base of quiche crust. Whisk together eggs; cream; dill; salt; pepper in a bowl. Scatter 2/3 of the salmon across quiche; folding/twisting pieces rather than laying flat. Top with cheese; pour over egg mixture. Top with remaining salmon and asparagus tips. Bake for 40 minutes or until top is light golden and centre is set but still slightly jiggly when you poke it. Rest for 10 minutes before carefully removing from tin and slicing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/quiche-crust/, Place flour; salt and butter in a food processor.  Pulse 10 times or until it looks like breadcrumbs. With the motor running on low; pour 2.5 tbsp of water into the tube feeder. Turn up to high and blitz for 30 seconds or until it turns into a ball of dough. Initially it will look like breadcrumbs; then it will turn into a ball of soft dough – some random escaped bits is fine. If it doesn’t look like its coming together at 20 seconds; add another 1/2 tbsp of water. Don’t blitz longer than 30 seconds at most. Form a disc; wrap in cling wrap. If there are escaped crumble bits; that’s fine – just press them in. Refrigerate for 1 – 3 hours. Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan forced) Sprinkle work surface with flour; unwrap dough and place on the flour. Sprinkle top with flour; then roll out into a 27cm/11″ round. Gently roll the pastry so it wraps around the rolling pin. Unroll it over the quiche pan or pie dish – 23cm / 9". Press the pastry into the edges of the quiche pan; patching up edges if required (if pastry doesn’t quite reach top of rim). Roll the rolling pin across the top to cut off the excess pastry. Optional extra “safe measure” refrigeration – 15 minutes. See (Note 2). Place a large piece of parchment paper over the pastry; then fill with baking beads or lots of rice or dried beans to weigh it down. (Note 3) Bake for 20 minutes; then remove from oven.  Turn oven DOWN to 180C/350F (or 160C/320F fan). Use excess paper to CAREFULLY remove hot beads; then return to oven for 10 minutes or until base is light golden. Remove from oven and fill with chosen Quiche Filling. Quiche Lorraine; Salmon Quiche; Italian Sausage or your other filling of choice.  The pastry will not be 100% cooked; it finishes cooking with the filling. It’s cooked enough so the crust will not go soggy.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-chowder-soup/, Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 5 minutes until translucent but not golden. Add carrots and stir through. Turn heat up to high and add wine. Stir then let it simmer rapidly until it’s mostly evaporated. Add flour and stir for 30 seconds – it will become sludgy! Slow pour in broth while stirring to dissolve paste; then stir in milk. Add potato; corn; salt and pepper. Bring to simmer then turn heat down so it’s simmering gently. Cook; stirring every now and then; for 8 minutes or until potato is almost cooked. Add fish and peas; simmer for 3 minutes or until fish is just cooked (should flake easily). Adjust salt and pepper to taste. If soup is too thick; add a touch of water or milk. Serve; garnished with green onions and crusty bread on the side for dunking!
https://www.recipetineats.com/white-chocolate-macadamia-nut-cookies/, Beat butter; sugar and salt on medium (speed 5) using a hand held mixer for 1 minute until smooth.

https://www.recipetineats.com/pork-carnitas-mexican-slow-cooker-pulled-pork/, Rinse and dry the pork shoulder; rub all over with salt and pepper. Combine the Rub ingredients then rub all over the pork. Place the pork in a slow cooker (fat cap up); top with the onion; jalapeño; minced garlic (don’t worry about spreading it) and squeeze over the juice of the oranges. Slow Cook on low for 10 hours or on high for 7 hours. (Note 2 for other cook methods) Pork should be tender enough to shred. Remove from slow cooker and let cool slightly. Then shred using two forks. Optional: Skim off the fat from the juices remaining in the slow cooker and discard.  If you have a lot more than 2 cups of juice; then reduce it down to about 2 cups. The liquid will be salty; it is the seasoning for the pork. Set liquid aside – don’t bother straining onion etc; it’s super soft. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large non stick pan or well seasoned skillet over high heat. Spread pork in the pan; drizzle over some juices. Wait until the juices evaporate and the bottom side is golden brown and crusty. Turn and just briefly sear the other side – you don’t want to make it brown all over because then it’s too crispy; need tender juicy bits. Remove pork from skillet. Repeat in batches (takes me 4 batches) – don’t crowd the pan. Just before serving; drizzle over more juices and serve hot; stuffed in tacos (see notes for sides; other serving suggestion and storage/make ahead).
https://www.recipetineats.com/salmon-patties/, Preheat oven to 220C/430F standard (200C fan) Place breadcrumbs in a bowl. Grate over onion; including juices. Mix onion into breadcrumbs; ensuring all breadcrumbs are soaked. (Note 3) Add remaining ingredients except salmon. Mix well. Add salmon. Stir through gently; leaving flakes of salmon (rather than vigorously mixing salmon into tiny pieces). Scoop up 1/4 cup mixture (level; packed standard ice cream scoop; see Video). Form round patties about 1.5 cm/ 2/3″ thick and set aside. Drizzle oil all over tray. Place in oven for 2 minutes until hot – oil will spread over tray. Tilt tray to spread if needed. Place patties on tray – DO NOT press down (makes them stick on tray). Spray surface with oil spray. Bake 15 minutes. Flip; spray surface with oil spray; bake 5 minutes. Serve with sour cream or yoghurt on the side for dipping / dolloping; and extra fresh dill if desired. I served mine with cauliflower puree and Yoghurt Slaw – healthy side options! (Note 3)
https://www.recipetineats.com/shortbread-cookies/, Preheat oven to 160C/325F (standard) or 150C/300F (fan forced / convection). Butter and line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ pan with baking paper with overhang. Beat butter until smooth (or use very soft butter and a wooden spoon). Add icing sugar and beat until combined. Add half the flour and beat until mostly combined – it will resemble wet sand. Then beat in the remainder. Use your hands to bring it together into a smooth ball of dough – knead lightly if required. Roughly press down into a rectangle shape; then transfer into the pan. Press into the pan. Optional: Roll over the top using a small rolling pin or glass (that’s what I used) for a smooth surface. Don’t press down too hard – it makes the cookies firmer Bake for 20 minutes until edges are very light golden and most of the surface is still pale gold. Remove from the oven. Working quickly; cut into desired shape (I do 8 x 3 bars; like Walker’s shortbread biscuits) and prick all over with a fork (optional). Return to the oven for 8 minutes or until the surface is light golden – not browned. Turn the oven off; crack it open ajar; then leave to cool for at least 1 hour in the oven. Remove from the oven; use paper overhang to remove the biscuits from the pan. Cool fully on rack. Serve with tea!!

Line tray with foil and baking / parchment paper. Place chicken upside down on tray. Drizzle chicken with about 1 tsp oil. Rub over with fingers. Sprinkle with Seasoning. Flip chicken. Drizzle with 1 tsp oil; rub with fingers; sprinkle with Seasoning; covering as much of the surface area as you can. Bake 18 minutes; or until surface is golden per photos and video; or internal temperature is 165°F/75°C using a meat thermometer. Remove from oven and immediately transfer chicken to serving plates. Wait 3 – 5 minutes before serving; garnished with freshly chopped parsley if desired. Pictured with a side of Garlic Butter Rice with Kale.
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-sausage-egg-mcmuffin/, Preheat oven to 130C/275F. Place muffins on a baking tray; cut side up; and top with cheese. (Alternative – melt cheese on sausage patties; see video) Mix Sausage Patty ingredients in a bowl – use your hands to mix it real good! Shape into 4 patties (thick ones; or 5 Maccers size patties). Make them slightly larger than the muffins because they will shrink when cooking. Heat oil in a large non stick skillet over high heat. Add patties (in batches if needed). Cook the first side for 2 – 3 minutes or until browned. Flip then cook the other side until browned. (Optional: After flipping; top with cheese; cover with lid to melt). Meanwhile; heat another pan over medium high heat with 1 tbsp oil. Spray egg rings with oil and place in the skillet. (Note 4 for other cook methods).  Crack egg into the rings. Add around 2 tbsp water into the skillet then cover with a lid. Cook for 1 – 2 minutes or until egg is cooked to your liking (I like runny yolks).  Remove warm muffins from the oven. Top with sausage; then egg; the lid of muffin. Serve and enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-pan-fried-fish/, Use scrunched up paper towels to pat the fish dry on both sides. This is especially important if you are using thawed frozen fish. Season the fish well on both sides with salt and pepper (key!). Mix the flour and paprika on a plate. Coat fish on both sides with flour; pressing down firmly so it adheres; but shake well to remove excess. (Note 2) Heat a heavy based skillet (normal or non stick) over medium high heat until you see wisps of smoke. Add oil and swirl to coat the pan – it will heat within seconds. Add fish – it should sizzle straight away. Shake the pan lightly to move the fish. Cook for 2 minutes until golden and crisp; pressing down gently; then flip. Cook the other side for 2 minutes until crisp then remove. If it’s browning too quickly; just remove pan from the stove briefly.  If it’s stuck; don’t move – it will release naturally once golden.  Serve fish immediately with lemon wedges and garnished with dill or parsley; if using. It starts to lose crispiness after 5 minutes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/gozleme/, Fit stand mixer with dough hook. Combine flour; oil; salt and water in the stand mixer bowl. Mix for 2.5 minutes on medium high speed 7 until smooth (see video for before & after). (Note 4) Dough should be a pliable; smooth ball; not sticky. Cover and rest for 20 minutes. Sprinkle work surface with flour. Cut dough into 4 pieces. Roll out into 35cm/14″ x 20cm/8″ rectangle. Make EITHER the lamb / beef Filling; or Spinach & Feta (or make 1/2 batch of both!). Heat oil in large skillet over high heat. Cook garlic and onion for 1 minute. Add capsicum; cook for 2 minutes. Add beef and cook until it changes from pink to brown; breaking it up as you go. Add cumin; paprika; cayenne (if using); salt; pepper and water. Cook for 2 minutes. Add spinach; stir until wilted. Cool before using. Place spinach; garlic; egg and pepper in a bowl. Scrunch with hands to reduce volume and make spinach “floppy”. Add feta and stir through. Spread Filling on half the pastry; pushing to the edge. Sprinkle Lamb/Beef Filling with crumbled feta. Sprinkle Spinach Feta with mozzarella cheese; if using. Fold other side of pastry over to cover Filling. Press down edges; pressing out excess air pockets trapped inside as you go. Use water if needed to seal well. Sprinkle flour on a round pizza paddle (or similar). Slide gozleme onto paddle. Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. (I usually get 2 pans going) Slide gozleme into skillet. Cook; lightly pressing down (including edges); until deep golden and crispy – about 3 minutes. Flip and cook; pressing down lightly; until crispy. Transfer to cutting board. Cut into 6 or 8 pieces. Serve immediately with lemon wedges; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheeseburger-casserole-homemade-hamburger-helper/, Heat oil in a dutch oven or large deep skillet over medium high heat.

Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT cheese. Stir to combine; add macaroni; then turn down to medium or medium low so it’s simmering gently. Cover; cook 8 minutes. Pasta should be just about cooked; and still nice and saucy. Add cheddar cheese; stir. Top with mozzarella cheese. Cover with lid; cook for a further 2 minutes.  Remove from stove. The pasta should now be cooked – tender but firm; not mushy; slick with sauce; not dried out. Serve immediately; garnished with green onions; if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/schnitzel/, Chicken breast prep: cut in half horizontally to create two steaks. Place the protein of choice on a work surface and cover with a sheet of baking paper or cling wrap. Use a rolling pin to pound to even thickness about 0.8 cm / 1/3″ thick (don’t pound too thin; hard to handle / might tear). Sprinkle both sides of meat with salt and pepper. Place flour in one dish; panko in another (or use a large tray for both like I did; see photos); and whisk eggs in a bowl. Coat meat in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg; shake off excess. Press into breadcrumbs; and turn; pressing to adhere; then transfer to plate. Repeat. Heat 1.5cm / 3/5″ oil in a heavy based deep skillet over medium high heat. Dip the end of a schnitzel in to check if the oil is hot enough – it should sizzle straight away (see video). Carefully place 2 schnitzels in the oil and cook for 3 minutes until deep golden; turn then cook the other side for 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining schnitzel.  Serve with lemon wedges – I usually serve schnitzel plain like this. Or see note for Mushroom Gravy recipe. Also see note for potato rosti; pictured in post.
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-chicken-satay-peanut-sauce/, If cooking on a BBQ or over charcoal; soak skewers for 2 hours in water. Mix together the chicken and Marinade with 1/4 cup of coconut milk; then set aside for at least 20 minutes; or overnight. Thread onto skewers – I do 4 to 5 pieces each. Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook skewers in batches for 3 minutes on each side until golden. Place remaining coconut milk and Peanut Sauce ingredients in a saucepan over medium low heat. Stir to combine then simmer; stirring every now and then; for 5 minutes. Adjust consistency with water – it should be a pourable but thickish sauce. Cover with lid and keep warm while cooking skewers. Pour some sauce into a bowl. Sprinkle with some peanuts – stir some through if you want. Pile satay skewers onto a platter; sprinkle with remaining peanuts; coriander and chilli. Serve with sauce on the side for dipping. Add a side of Jasmine Rice or Thai Fried Rice to complete the meal!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-stroganoff/, Use your fist (or rolling pin or mallet) to flatten the steaks to about 3/4cm / 1/3″ thick. Slice into 5mm / 1/5″ strips (cut long ones in half); discarding excess fat. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat. Scatter half the beef in the skillet; QUICKLY spread it with tongs. Leave untouched for 30 seconds until browned. Turn beef quickly (as best you can!). Leave untouched for 30 seconds to brown. Immediately remove onto a plate. Don’t worry about pink bits and that it will be raw inside. Add remaining 1 tbsp oil and repeat with remaining beef. Turn heat down to medium high. Add butter; melt. Then add onions; cook for 1 minute; then add mushrooms. Cook mushrooms until golden. Scrape bottom of fry pan to get all the golden bits off (this is flavour!). Add flour; cook; stirring; for 1 minute. Add half the broth while stirring. Once incorporated; add remaining broth. Stir; then add sour cream and mustard. Stir until incorporated (don’t worry if it looks split; sour cream will “melt” as it heats). Bring to simmer ;then reduce heat to medium low. Once it thickens to the consistency of pouring cream (3 – 5 minutes); adjust salt and pepper to taste. Add beef back in (including plate juices). Simmer for 1 minute; then remove from stove immediately. (Note 4) Serve over pasta or egg noodles; sprinkled with chives if desired.

(Note 4) Cook for 1 1/2 minutes until a few bubbles appear and underside is mostly golden. Flip with confidence. Cook a further 1 minute – poke centre; should spring back; underside should be golden. Transfer to rack and keep warm in 100C/200F oven in single layer (do not stack). Or get 2 pans going (won’t need to keep warm) Repeat with remaining batter; using extra butter as required. Serve with copious amounts of maple syrup and softened butter.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roast-chicken/, Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat oven to 220C/450F (standard) or 200C/430F (fan/convection). Put shelf in the middle. Mix together Butter ingredients. Add juice from 2 wedges of lemon. Place chicken in a roasting pan. Use a dessert spoon to loosen skin from chicken (see video). Do the top (the breast) and the drumsticks – not the underside. Prop chicken upright; drizzle butter under skin; using most of the garlic/herb sludge; but saving a bit of butter for the skin (Note 3). Drizzle / smear remaining butter all over surface of the chicken. Squeeze over juice of 2 lemon wedges. Stuff used lemon wedges and rosemary inside chicken. Tie drumstick ends with string and tuck wing tips under the chicken. Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Place onion and garlic in the pan; place chicken on top. Pour wine around; drizzle chicken with oil. Transfer to oven. Roast for 10 minutes; then turn oven down to 180C/350F (all oven types). Roast for a further 1 hr 15 minutes; or until the internal temperature is 75C/165F or until juices run clear when pierced at the join between the drumstick and the body. Baste twice (30 min then at 1 hr); spooning pan juices over skin. Rest for 15 minutes – don’t cover; skin becomes wet. Serve with pan juices (see video for how to carve). I discard onion but use the garlic in the pan. See notes for side suggestions & how to use carcass for incredible homemade broth!
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-stew/, Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Heat 1 1/2 tbsp oil in a large; heavy based casserole pot over high heat until just starting to smoke.

(Note 3 for other cooking methods) Cover and cook for 1 hour 45 minutes or until beef is pretty tender (check with 2 forks at 1.5 hrs). Remove lid and simmer for further 30 minutes or until sauce reduces slightly. It should be like a thin gravy (see video) and beef should now be very tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve over creamy mashed potato with a sprig of fresh thyme for decoration or a sprinkle of parsley (Note 4).
https://www.recipetineats.com/magic-broccoli/, Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Cut/break broccoli into florets and pile onto baking tray. (Note 2 re: stem) Toss – Drizzle all over with extra virgin olive oil; scatter with garlic; salt and pepper. Toss with fingers or tongs; then spread out over tray in a single layer (or toss in large bowl or ziplock bag).  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes until the tips of the florets are slightly browned and crispy. The broccoli should be "tender crisp"; meaning just cooked through; not soft and floppy. Finish – Remove from the oven and immediately drizzle over the lemon juice; zest; and parmesan. Toss quickly; transfer to serving plate and garnish with a bit more parmesan. Serve warm!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-chicken-noodle-soup-from-scratch/, Place the chicken in a large pot.

(Or 8 hours on low in a slow cooker) Scoop scum off surface once or twice during first 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to pan. Shred meat and discard bones. You'll only need half the chicken meat; save the rest for another purpose. Remove carrots; celery etc from broth; and discard. Optional: Chop carrot and celery; add back into soup with chicken. (Note 5) Optional: Refrigerate soup for a few hours until the fat sets; then scoop the fat off the surface (I do this; healthier & makes soup clearer). Heat oil in a large pot over medium meat. Add onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add celery and carrots; cook for 5 minutes until softened and a bit sweet; don’t let them brown. Turn heat up to medium high. Gently pour 8 cups broth in (top up with water if necessary); leaving behind residue settled in the bottom of the broth pot.  Add Vegeta (stock powder); thyme; bay leaf and pepper. Stir.

Stir; bring to simmer; then cover. Turn down to medium low and cook for 12 minutes. Remove lid – there should still be liquid on the surface. Working quickly; add broccoli; push down so it’s partly submerged; cover and cook for a further 3 minutes until broccoli is just cooked. Preheat grill/broiler. Remove lid and stir through half the cheese – don’t worry if it looks a bit too saucy; excess liquid gets sucked up in minutes (see video). Smooth surface; top with remaining cheese. Grill/broil until melted (or just put lid on and allow to melt with residual heat on turned off stove). Serve immediately; garnished with parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/outrageous-nutella-brownies/, Grease a 20cm/8″ square pan with butter then line with parchment/baking paper with overhang. Scrape Nutella into pan; spread.

Cook chicken: Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan).  Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes; or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade). Sauce: Add the tomato passata; cream; sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.

https://www.recipetineats.com/prawn-cocktail/, If you are using whole prawns; remove heads and peel them. Leave a few whole for decorative purposes; if you wish. I find that with medium size already cooked prawns; deveining is usually not necessary (it’s hard to do + so small it’s barely noticeably especially with sauce). Mix together Sauce in a small bowl. Toss prawns with Sauce. Place a bit of lettuce in serving dishes. I like to use Martini glasses; but you can use any small serving vessel; or even small lettuce cups. Top with prawns. Serve; garnished with lemon wedges and a sprinkle of parsley; if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-garlic-crack-bread-pull-apart-bread/, Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Combine butter; garlic and salt in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave. Stir through parsley. Cut the bread on a diagonal into 2cm/1″ diamonds but do not cut all the way through the bread. Use your fingers or a knife to pry open each crack and drizzle in a teaspoon of butter and stuff in a pinch of cheese. This might sound like a bit of an effort; but I promise you it is worth it! You don’t need to be super neat; it’s nice to have some of the butter drizzled over the crust. Brush surface with remaining butter.  Wrap with foil and bake for 20 minutes until the cheese has mostly melted; then unwrap and bake for 5 – 10 minutes more to make the bread nice and crusty. Serve immediately. (See note 1 for best make ahead methods)
https://www.recipetineats.com/hot-corn-dip/, Preheat oven to 160C/320F. Cut the corn off the cob. Tip: Use bundt pan or ramekin. in large bowl; see video. If using frozen corn; no need to thaw. Melt 1 tbsp butter then add 2 tsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Add half the corn and half the garlic. Cook; stirring (or tossing!) for 3 minutes or until corn is golden (golden = better flavour). Transfer corn to bowl; repeat with remaining corn. If the skillet looks dry; add a touch of oil. Add both capsicums and onion; cook for 2 minutes until softened. Add to bowl with corn. Add half the cheese into the bowl; then all the remaining ingredients. Mix; transfer to baking dish. Top with remaining cheese. Bake 30 minutes or until golden and bubbly on top.

Cut into thick slices and serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/, Take ham out of the fridge 1 hour prior. Preheat oven to 160C / 320F (standard) or 140C / 285F (fan). Arrange shelf in lower third so the ham will be sitting in the centre of the oven (not right at the top of the oven; this causes more uneven cooking on surface). Remove the rind (skin) of the ham; ensuring you leave the fat on (Note 5 for steps; photos in post and video above) Scoring – Cut 2.5cm / 1″ diamonds into the fat (don’t cut into flesh). Place brown sugar; honey; mustard; cider vinegar; pepper and Spices into saucepan over medium high heat. Simmer and stir until sugar is dissolved. Place rack in a baking pan and place ham on rack. Baste all over with the glaze (except the handle); including underside and the cut face. Reserve remaining glaze for basting. Bake for 1.5 hours; basting every 20 minutes with reserved glaze (Note 6) and pan juices; until caramelised and the internal temperature is 60C/140F. (Note 7)  Stick bits of foil on parts that are browning too quickly; and you can even lower the oven temp. (Note 8) Rest ham for 15 to 30 minutes+; basting generously with the pan drippings – use it like paint to make your ham beautifully bronzed all over with a thick glaze. (Note 9) Whisk water into pan juices until it’s a thick honey-like pouring consistency. Wrap handle with baking paper; secure in place with ribbon. Stick in rosemary sprigs. Place ham on table as centrepiece with Sauce on the side. Lovely served warm or at room temp! Once everyone has oohed and aahed over it; nominate someone to be the Ham Carver! Slice thinly and serve with sauce. Leftovers: See list in post for recipe using leftover ham and ham bone!  Storing: Will keep for at least a week in the fridge if properly stored using a water-vinegar soaked ham bag or pillowcase. Otherwise freeze – don't forget the bone! See How to Store Glazed Ham for directions.
https://www.recipetineats.com/strawberry-cheesecake/, Preheat oven to 160C/320F (standard) or 140C/295F (fan/convection). Get a 20cm/8″ springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (Note 4); butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out; see photos in post and video. Butter and line the side of the pan. Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz until fine crumbs (Note 5). Add butter; briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand. Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls. Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides; and flatten the base. Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until just smooth; no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4. (You do not want to aerate cheesecake filling as it causes cracks when it bakes) Add flour; beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated. Add vanilla; sour cream; sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 sec max; speed 5). Add eggs one at a time; beat in between until just combined (5 sec each); and after the last one; beat just until the egg is fully incorporated. Pour into prepared crust. Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown; not cracked; and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan. Cool the cake in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8″ (Note 6); then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan. Remove sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper. Place chopped strawberries; vanilla; sugar and lemon juices in a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 10 minutes until strawberries breakdown. Mix cornflour with water; then add into saucepan and stir. Add halved strawberries and cook for 1 minute to soften. Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. Will thicken as it cools. Once cool; stirl. Adjust thickness to make it the right “oozing” consistency (see video; Note 7) with a tiny touch of water (be careful!). Spoon onto cheesecake so it’s covered with a single layer of strawberries. Flip strawberry halves so they are facedown. Refrigerate 2 hours+. Slice and serve with remaining Strawberry Sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-appetiser-italian-cheese-log/, Spray a loaf pan with oil then line with cling wrap with overhang. Mix Cheese Log ingredients together. Taste and adjust salt if needed (bear in mind saltiness of crackers you are serving with). Scrape into loaf pan and level surface; pressing to remove air pockets. Smaller pan = taller loaf. Cover with cling wrap overhang and refrigerate for 4 hours+ (up to 1 week). Turn out onto platter; peel off cling wrap. Top with sun dried tomato and pour over oil. Garnish with parsley and rosemary sprigs to give it a festive look. Best to serve closer to room temp than fridge cold. Serve with crackers! Knives for smearing optional – it’s soft enough to scoop with crackers.
https://www.recipetineats.com/paris-mash-creamy-mashed-potato/, Scrub potatoes clean. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil then reduce heat and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes until the potatoes are very soft (depends on size). Alternatively; peel then chop into 2.5cm / 1″ cubes (Note 4); cook 12 to 15 minutes until soft. Drain potatoes and return empty pot to stove. Using tea towels to handle the hot potatoes; peel them using a small knife (skin should slide off pretty easily). Mash the potatoes using one of these methods: Press them through a potato ricer or a food mill / grinder fitted with the finest disc; or mash in the pot using a potato masher (preferably with round holes; yields a similar result to potato ricer). Pro step: Then pass the potato through a drum sieve for 100% smooth mashed potato; like you get at restaurants. I do not do this (read in post) Turn stove on low and stir mashed potato for 1 minute (evaporate excess water). Add a few cubes of butter and a little splash of milk. Stir until butter melts and is incorporated. Repeat until all butter is used up; using milk to adjust the consistency to your desired taste towards the end. It should be soft and creamy; almost pourable. Season to taste with salt. Pour into serving bowl. Use a spoon to create swirls on the surface; top with small dollop of butter and a tiny sprinkle of parsley. Serve immediately!

https://www.recipetineats.com/turkey-gravy/, Place the roasting pan on the stove over medium heat. Single burner is fine; but ideal if it fits across two. Leave garlic; onion etc and other flavourings things in the pan (Note 1) When it starts sizzling/bubbling; add flour. Cook for 1 minute; stirring constantly. Gradually pour the liquid in; mixing constantly. Once it’s all in; it should be lump free. If not; use a whisk – whisk around the onion etc. Simmer until it thickens to taste – gravy will thicken more as it cools. Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Strain into a bowl; pressing the juices out of the onion; garlic etc. then discard them. Pour gravy into jug and serve with turkey. Tip: To keep gravy warm; store in a thermos! Strain all the juices from the slow cooker into a bowl. If you have less than 2 cups (500ml); top up with store bought broth (chicken or turkey). I have never had to do this. If you have more; use all the slow cooker juices (just needs to reduce longer to thicken). Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Slow add broth; stirring constantly. Mix until lump free – switch to whisk if required. Simmer for a few minutes until it thickens to desired consistency. Add dark soy sauce (or gravy darkener) to achieve desired colour without affecting taste. Start with the amount per ingredients; then add more if you want to darken. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour into jug and serve. TIP: Keep gravy warm in a thermos until required.
https://www.recipetineats.com/genius-easy-juicy-roast-turkey-dry-brined/, Rub turkey with the Salt Rub; wrap mummy-like in cling wrap. Fridge 48 hrs; flipping halfway. Stuff; roast upside down 30min in hot 220°C/425°F (200°C fan) oven; flip; garlic-herb-butter baste; finish roasting in lower oven 165°C/325°F (150°C fan). Salt Rub: Mix together the Rub ingredients. Prep Turkey: Pat the turkey dry with paper towels; inside and out. Remove giblets or anything else inside the turkey. (Note 5) Sprinkle: Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the Salt Rub inside the turkey and use you hand to spread it (roughly is fine). Turn the turkey upside down; then rub 1 teaspoon of the Salt Rub on the underside. Turn the turkey upright and rub the remaining Salt Rub on the turkey; using most on the breast – even some under the skin if you can. Wrap turkey mummy-like in lots of cling wrap (works best; I find) or place the turkey in a sealable plastic bag (Note 6). Place turkey upside down in baking pan. Refrigerate 2 days (minimum) up to 3 days (4 days adds nothing; I find). 24 hours later: Flip turkey so it's right side up. 24 (to 48 hours) later: unwrap turkey. The skin should be moist but not wet. If wet; pat dry. Leave out for 30 min before roasting. Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan-forced) Prep for roasting: Place the onions and garlic in a roasting pan. Place a roasting rack on top – if you have one (Note 8 for sub). Stuff bunch of herbs + 2 garlic halves + 3 tbsp butter (45g) inside the turkey. Tie drumsticks together with kitchen twine (optional).  Place turkey UPSIDE DOWN on the rack. Twist the wings so they are on top – see video. Brush with a bit of melted butter. Sprinkle with a tiny bit of salt and pepper.  Wine – Pour wine in roasting pan. Roast for 30 minutes. Flip & brush – Use a tea towel to turn the turkey over so it's right side up. Brush with butter; sprinkle with a tiny bit of salt and pepper. Turn oven down to 165°C/325°F (150°C fan).  Roast turkey 45 minutes.  Garlic herb butter: Mix remaining butter with garlic and herbs. Brush turkey generously with butter. Roast turkey for a further 30 minutes or until a) the thermometer that comes with the turkey pops up; or b) a thermometer inserted between the breast and leg reads 165°F/75°C. (Notes 9; 10). Cover loosely with foil if browning too much. Rest: Remove turkey onto serving plate; cover loosely with foil and rest for 30 minutes before transferring to platter for presentation and carving (see in post for styling idea). Serve turkey with gravy and/or Cranberry Sauce. Place roasting pan (with garlic; onion etc still in it) on the stove over medium high heat. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add broth and use a potato masher to mash the onion and garlic into the mixture. Use a wooden spoon to scrap the bottom of the pan. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until thickened. Strain into a bowl; pressing down to extract all the flavour out of the onion and garlic. Transfer to gravy boat.

https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-burritos/, Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 2 minutes until onion is lightly browned. Add beef and cook; breaking it up as you go; until it turns from red to brown. Add Taco Seasoning (or use 1 packet store bought) and cook for 1 minute. Then add tomato paste and water; cook for 3 minutes until the water is mostly evaporated but the beef is still juicy; not dried out. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes – piping hot filling will steam the burrito; making the tortilla soggy. Optional: If not warming rolled burrito; warm the tortillas before rolling (per packet directions). Place a burrito on a work surface. Place 1/4 – 1/3 cup of rice just below the centre. Top with 1/4 – 1/3 cup beef; then some lettuce; corn; black beans; tomato;  a sprinkle of red onion; coriander and cheese. Fold up the bottom to cover the filling then fold the edges in (video helpful to see how to do this). Roll up tightly; then wrap in foil. Serve as is or heat per below. HEATING: To warm through; pan fry (dry pan) in the foil over medium high heat for a few minutes on each side to slightly crisp and warm the outside. Or for 10+ minutes on a medium low heat if you want to melt the cheese. Or they can be baked at 180C/350F for 20 minutes in the foil – this will warm them all the way through and crisp up the tortilla slightly. If they are straight from the fridge; they will take around 30 minutes to warm through. Burritos are best served with something to dollop/dip – sour cream (or yoghurt) and some sort of chilli sauce are my usual because it’s easy. When I’m making more of an effort; I use  Restaurant Style Salsa or Guacamole.

Don’t turn the prawn into a complete paste; small chunks are good. Use My Way (better Wonton Soup experience!) or the Asian Grocery Store Way (easier to pack for freezing). Lay Wontons on work surface. Use 2 teaspoons to put the Filling on the wontons. Work in batches of 5 if starting out; up to 15 or 20 if confident. Brush 2 edges with water. Fold to seal; pressing out air. Brush water on one corner and bring corners together; pressing to seal. Place wrapped wontons into a container with a lid as you work (so they don’t dry out). To cook: bring a large pot of water to boil. Place wontons in water and cook for 4 minutes or until they float. Remove with slotted spoon straight into serving bowls. Ladle over broth. To freeze: Freeze uncooked in airtight containers. Cook from frozen for 6 to 8 minutes. IMPORTANT: Do not freeze if you made this with defrosted frozen prawns. (Note 11) Place Broth ingredients in a saucepan over high heat. Add white ends of scallions/shallots if leftover from Wonton filling.  Place lid on; bring to simmer then reduce to medium high and simmer for 5 – 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. Pick garlic and ginger out before using. If using vegetables; blanch in the soup broth and place in serving bowl. Prepare noodles according to packet directions (if using noodles). Place in serving bowl with cooked wontons and blanched vegetables. Ladle over soup. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-pork-loin-roast/, Spice Rub: Rub pork with about 1 tsp oil. Mix Rub together then sprinkle over pork. Pat to adhere all over. Brown: Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pork and sear all around until deep golden brown (don’t let spices burn). Place pork in slow cooker. Honey Butter Sauce: Wipe pan. Add butter and melt. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until golden. Add remaining Sauce ingredients; mix; simmer rapidly for 30 seconds. Pour Sauce over pork. Cover slow cooker.  Pork loin – Cook on LOW for 4 to 5 hours (see Note 2 for cook times for different sizes) Pork Shoulder – Cook on LOW for 10 hours (see Note 2 for cook times for different sizes; and Note 4 for oven; InstantPot and pressure cooker methods). Remove pork onto serving platter; cover loosely with foil (10 – 20 minutes rest). (See Note 6 on Doneness) Pour all juices in slow cooker into large saucepan. Add cornflour water mixture; mix. Thicken Sauce: Simmer on medium high for 5 minutes or until it reduces down to a syrupy consistency (Note 3). Slice pork into thick slices (1.5 – 2 cm / 3/5 – 4/5″ thick). Serve with PLENTY of Honey Butter Sauce!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cornbread-muffins/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Brush a 12 hole standard muffin tin with melted butter. Combine Dry ingredients in a bowl and give them a quick stir to combine. Whisk Wet ingredients in a bowl until combined. Pour Wet into Dry ingredients. Mix until combined. Spoon the batter into the greased muffin tray – use it all up; fill the holes right up! Bake in the oven for 20 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Remove muffin tray from the oven. Optional: Brush tops with melted butter. Cool for 5 minutes then remove muffins onto a rack.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vegetable-pasta/, Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic and onion – cook slowly for 3 to 4 minutes until onion is translucent and sweet. Turn heat up to medium high; add zucchini and capsicum. Cook 1 1/2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT pasta and broccoli. Stir until tomato paste dissolves. When liquid starts bubbling; lower heat to medium; add pasta and stir. Top with broccoli; push in. Place lid on and cook for 5 minutes. Remove lid. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes; stirring frequently; until pasta is almost cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta. Stir through half the cheese (if using). Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining cheese; put lid on. Leave for 1 minute until cheese is melted and pasta is perfectly cooked. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. Don’t leave leftovers in the pot; residual heat will overcook the pasta so transfer into a serving dish.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-mousse/, For reliable results; work at a steady pace so your whipped egg whites and cream do not get too warm! Separate eggs and yolks while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients. (Note 4) Yolks: Whisk yolks until uniform. Melt chocolate and butter: Break chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-proof bowl with the butter. Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts; stirring in between; until smooth. (Stir in optional flavourings at this point; but read Note 6 first). Set aside to cool slightly while you proceed with other steps.  Whip cream: Beat cream until stiff peaks form; being careful not to over-whip (see video). Whip whites: Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form (see video; Note 5) Fold egg yolks into cream using a rubber spatula – 8 folds max. Some streaks is fine. Check chocolate temperature: The chocolate should still be runny but warm (min 35C / 95F; ideal 40C / 104F). If too cool or thick; microwave in burst of 5 seconds at a time until runny. Pour chocolate into cream yolk mixture. Fold through – 8 folds max. Some streaks here are ok. Add 1/4 of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold through until incorporated – "smear" the spatular across surface to blend white lumps in – aim for 10 folds.  Pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Fold through until incorporated and no more white lumps remain – aim for 12 folds max; but ensure there are no obvious egg white patches. Divide mixture between 4 small glasses or pots. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours; preferably overnight. To serve; garnish with cream and chocolate shavings. Raspberries and a tiny sprig of mint for colour would also be lovely!
https://www.recipetineats.com/classic-italian-meatballs-extra-soft-and-juicy/, Grate the onion using a standard box grater in a large bowl until you have about 1/2 cup of grated onion and juices.  Add bread; mix to combine so the onion juice soaks the bread and disintegrates. Set aside while you prep the other ingredients (5 min or so). Add all the remaining Meatball ingredients. Use hands to mix well. Measure out a heaped tablespoon and roll lightly to form a ball. Repeat with remaining mixture. (Note 5) Heat 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil in a large non stick fry pan over medium high heat. Add the meatballs and brown all over – about 3 – 4 minutes.  When they are browned but NOT cooked through; carefully transfer them onto a plate. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil into the fry pan.  Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent. Add the remaining Sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer; then turn down to medium low so it bubbles gently rather than splattering everywhere. Carefully transfer the meatballs and any juices that have pooled on the plate into the Sauce. Cook the meatballs for 8 – 10 minutes; turning and stirring occasionally. Adjust Sauce salt and pepper to taste. While the meatballs are cooking; cook your pasta of choice. Serve the meatballs on pasta; garnished with extra parmesan and parsley if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/poached-salmon-in-coconut-lime-sauce/, Sprinkle both sides of salmon with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non stick pan or well seasoned skillet over medium high heat. Add salmon; skin side up; and sear for just 1 1/2 minutes until golden. Turn salmon and cook the other side just for 1 minute; then remove onto a plate (should still be raw inside). Turn heat down to medium low and allow skillet to cool. Heat remaining 1 tbsp oil. Add garlic; ginger and lemongrass. Cook until garlic is light golden ~ 1 minute. Add sugar and cook for 20 seconds until it becomes a caramel (see video). Then stir in chilli paste. Add coconut milk and stir; scraping the bottom of the skillet to dissolve any bits stuck on the base into the sauce. Stir in fish sauce; increase heat to medium. Simmer for 2 minutes. Place salmon into the sauce; lower heat and simmer gently for 4 minutes; or until just cooked. Remove salmon; stir in lime zest and juice to taste. Adjust salt to taste with fish sauce. Serve salmon over noodles or rice. Spoon over sauce; garnish with coriander and chili if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-taco-soup/, Heat oil in a pot over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion; cook until softened (3 min). Add beef and turn up the heat to high. Cook; breaking it up as you go; until it all changes from pink to brown. Add remaining Soup ingredients and Taco Seasoning. Bring to a simmer then turn heat down to medium. Simmer for 10 minutes to bring the flavours together. Adjust thickness with water if desired. This is how I like to serve it: place a handful of corn chips in the bowl. Ladle in soup. Top with sour cream; cheese; coriander and a few crushed corn chips. For a healthier option; skip the corn chips in the bowl and/or serve more on the top / side of the soup.
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-lemon-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°Cfan).

Coat potatoes: Place potatoes in a roasting pan with all the other ingredients. Toss well. Roast 45 minutes: Roast for 20 minutes. Turn potatoes; roast for a further 25 to 30 minutes until the liquid is mostly absorbed by potatoes/evaporated and you're left with mainly oil in the pan. To crisp the potatoes (optional): Transfer potatoes to a separate tray. (Note 3) Tilt the original roasting pan and scoop off as much of the oil as you can (some juices is ok); then drizzle over the potatoes. Roast 35 minutes: Transfer potatoes to oven and roast for 35 – 40 minutes; turning once or twice; until potatoes are golden and a bit crispy on the edges. Heat pan juices: Return pan #1 with the garlic juices to the oven for the last 5 – 10 minutes or so to reduce down and make the garlic golden. (Optional; Note 4) Plate up: Transfer potatoes to serving platter. Drizzle over the reduced garlic pan juices (or toss potatoes in the pan). Serve; garnished with lemon wedges and oregano if desired. 
https://www.recipetineats.com/baklava/, You will need a 23 x 33 cm / 9 x 13" baking pan. For best results; thaw phyllo pastry overnight in the fridge (even if the pack says otherwise) then take out of the fridge 30 minutes prior. Cut phyllo to the size of the baking pan. Keep pastry covered with a damp tea towel at all times. Place nuts and cinnamon in a food processor. Pulse 15 times or until fine crumbs - don't let it turn into powder. Preheat oven to 160C / 325F. Base: Brush base of pan with butter. Lay over one sheet of phyllo. Brush with butter. Repeat to use 10 sheets; brushing every single sheet with butter. Scatter over 3/4 cup walnuts. Mid layers: Cover with 5 sheets of phyllo; brushing every sheet with butter. Top with 3/4 cup walnuts. Repeat 3 more times. Top: Cover with 10 sheets of phyllo; brushing every sheet with butter; including the final layer. Cut the baklava into 4 long strips; then cut on the diagonal to make diamonds. (Note 3) Bake for 1 hour - 1 hr 15 minutes until golden brown. Meanwhile; make syrup (needs time to cool) Remove from oven and immediately pour over syrup. Leave to soak for at least 6 hours; preferably overnight. Check to ensure each piece is cut all the way through; then serve. Keeps for a week! Place ingredients in a saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a simmer; stir to dissolve sugar. Lower heat to medium and simmer for 3 minutes; remove from heat and cool.
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-chicken/, Mix Marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add chicken and coat well. Marinade for 24 hours (3 hours minimum). Preheat oven to 180C.350F. Line a tray with foil (trust me); place rack on tray (optional). Place chicken on rack (reserve marinade); skin side up. Bake 30 minutes; Remove from oven. Brush with marinade – do not flip. Return to oven for 20 minutes or until golden and a bit crispy. Give it a spray of olive oil just before it’s done if you want an extra crispy; shiny coat. Rest for a few minutes before serving. Juicy and tasty enough to serve plain but extra great with tzatziki or even some plain yogurt.
https://www.recipetineats.com/falafel-recipe/, Place chickpeas in a large bowl and pour over plenty of cold water. Leave to soak 12 + hours (even 2 days is fine). Drain chickpeas well. Place in food processor; add remaining Falafel ingredients. Blitz for 2 to 3 minutes on high; scraping down sides as necessary; until the chickpeas are very small grains. Mixture should look like smooth guacamole from the outside (see video). Scoop up heaped tablespoons and shape into balls (or dome; disc or torpedo); place on a tray. Should make around 20; about 2.5cm / 1″ wide. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Pour oil in a skillet or large pot – at least 1.7 cm / 2/3″ depth (Note 4). Heat on medium high to 180 – 190C / 355F (or drop a bit in; should sizzle energetically). Place a ball in a large spoon (or tongs) and slide ball in. Cook in batches for around 4 minutes; using 2 forks to roll; until deep golden and super crusty on the outside. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining falafel. Serve fresh out of the fryer with Sauce of choice! Make falafel wraps or plates with tabbouleh; tomato; onion; and Sauces of choice. See Notes 5 and 6. Combine tahini and lemon juice; and mix well. The mixture will stiffen. Stir in the water 1 tbsp at a time and it will loosen again. The final consistency should be like a thick drizzle sauce (see video). Season to taste with salt.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mushroom-sauce/, Heat oil and melt butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms and leisurely cook until golden brown – takes about 4 to 5 minutes. No need to stir constantly. Just before they’re done; add the garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until garlic is golden (~ 1 minute). Add white wine – it will sizzle! Stir; scraping the bottom of the skillet; for 1 minute or until mostly evaporated. Add broth; cream and parmesan. Stir; then lower heat to medium so the sauce is simmering – do not boil rapidly; cream may split. Stir occasionally and simmer for 2 – 3 minutes until it thickens. It shouldn’t be super thick; this is a rich sauce. Stir through thyme; adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove from stove.  Serve over steak or other cooked protein. Toss through pasta; stuff into baked potatoes; serve with roast beef; chicken or pork; smothered omelettes. See in post for more ideas!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chilli-con-carne/, Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

Bring to simmer; then adjust heat per step below: Quick Cook – 20 to 40 minutes; uncovered; on medium low heat so it’s bubbling gently; OR Slow Cook – 1.5 hours to 2 hours; covered; on low heat so it’s bubbling very gently. (Note 3 Slow Cooker) Adjust salt to taste just before serving. Serve over rice; or ladle into bowls and serve with corn chips or warm tortillas on the side with Toppings of choice (Note 6). See Note 7 for more serving options. My usual: Either over rice or with corn chips; always with sour cream; cheese and coriander.
https://www.recipetineats.com/tomato-basil-rice/, Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; cook until translucent; 2 – 3 minutes. Add basil and cook for 20 seconds – don’t let it burn. Add remaining ingredients except basil.

Cut fish fillets into square-ish shapes slightly larger than the buns (they shrink when cooked).  Mix Batter ingredients in a bowl. Carefully coat fish in batter (handle with care; fish fillets can be delicate). Place in breadcrumbs. Use other hand to cover top and sides with breadcrumbs; pressing to adhere. Transfer to tray. Repeat with remaining fish. Bake 12 – 15 minutes until fish is cooked through. Immediately top with cheese – allow residual heat to make it semi melt (do not oven melt processed cheese; you get a plasticy film!). Cut buns in half; microwave for 20 seconds to warm through (microwave = stays soft). Top with fish and cheese; dollop with tartare sauce. Devour!
https://www.recipetineats.com/massaman-curry/, Remove reedy outer layers and trim lemongrass per Note 1.  Reserve all the trimmings (for beef). Finely chop the white part (for paste. Place Beef ingredients in a medium saucepan. Liquid should almost cover beef but not completely – if not; add water. Add lemongrass trimmings.

Add potatoes and cook for 7 minutes or until potatoes are tender; turning as required. Add beef and simmer for 2 minutes or until sauce has reduced and thickened. Adjust: saltiness with fish sauce; sour with tamarind and sweet with sugar. The taste should be sweet; salty and sour; with more emphasis on the sweet and sour notes. Top up with a little water if the curry seems too thick Serve over jasmine rice; garnished with peanuts (essential!) plus optional crispy Asian shallots and fresh chillies.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-zucchini-fritters/, Grate zucchini using a box grater. Grate on the diagonal so you get long strands. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Mix; then leave for 10 minutes+. Squeeze out excess water using hands (or bundle up tea towel) then place zucchini in a bowl. Preheat oven to 200F/100C (for keeping fritters warm). Place rack on tray (helps keep crispy) Add egg; green onions; parmesan and garlic into the zucchini bowl. Mix to combine. Scatter over flour and baking powder (don’t dump in one spot); and add pinch of pepper. Mix until flour is just incorporated – batter should be thick but soft (see video; Note 1). Heat 2 tbsp oil in a non stick pan over medium high heat (or medium if stove is strong). Drop 1/4 cup batter in the pan (ice cream scoop is perfect). Do 3 or 4 mounds. Flatten lightly with spatula to about 1cm / 4/5″ thick. Cook for 3 minutes until underside is deep golden (adjust heat if browning too quickly). Flip and cook the other side for 3 minutes. Transfer to tray and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with a dollop of yoghurt or sour cream and garnish of extra green onions if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/strawberry-crumble/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place all ingredients except butter in a bowl. Mix to combine. Add butter and mix to incorporate. Hull / cut top off strawberries. Cut larger ones in half; leave small ones whole (2cm / 4/5″ height). Place strawberries in bowl. Scatter over cornflour; toss well to coat evenly. Add sugar; water and vanilla. Mix well. Pour strawberries into a baking pan (Note 2). Crumble over topping; using your fingers to get some nice crumbly chunks. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until the Topping is deep golden and the strawberry syrup is bubbling up energetically all around the edges – see video; this is a key sign that the strawberry sauce has thickened sufficiently. Stand for a few minutes before serving with ice cream or your choice of topping.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-potato-salad/, Dressing: Shake in a jar. Halve so they are about 2.5cm / 1″ pieces (cut large ones into 3). Bring 4 litres / 4 quarts water to the boil; add salt. Add potatoes; bring back up to the boil then reduce to simmer. Cook for 5 minutes or until just cooked – don’t let them overcook or become too soft; they will keep cooking from residual heat. Drain and immediately transfer to a bowl. While potatoes are hot; pour over half the Dressing. Use rubber spatular to gently stir. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes; even overnight. Add green onions and parsley; pour over remaining Dressing. Carefully toss with rubber spatular; then serve. Great warm or at room temperature; and it’s also great the next day.
https://www.recipetineats.com/biryani/, Mix Marinade in a large pot (about 26cm / 11″ diameter). Add chicken and coat well. Marinade 20 minutes to overnight. Bring 3 litres / 3 quarts water to the boil; add salt and spices. Add rice; bring back up to the boil then cook for 4 minutes; or until rice is just cooked still a bit firm in the middle. Rice will taste salty at this stage; disappears in next stage of cooking. Drain immediately. Set aside. (Note 10 re: leaving whole spices in) Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook onion; in batches; for 3 to 4 minutes; until golden brown. Don’t burn – they become bitter. Remove onto paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining onion. Place in a bowl; leave for 10 minutes+. Place pot with chicken in it onto a stove over medium heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove lid. Cook for 5 minutes; turning chicken twice. Remove from heat. Turn chicken so skin side is down – it should cover most of the base of the pot. Scatter over half the onion then half the coriander. Top with all the rice. Gently pat down and flatten surface. Drizzle saffron across rice surface in random pattern; then drizzle over ghee. Place lid on. Return to stove over medium heat. As soon as you see steam; turn down to low then cook for 25 minutes. Remove from stove; rest with lid on for 10 minutes. Aim to serve it so you get nice patches of yellow rice; white rice; the curry stained rice + chicken (rather than all mixed up). To do this; use a large spoon and dig deep into the pot; and try to scoop up as much as you can in one scoop. Turn out into bowl – or onto platter. Garnish with remaining onion and coriander with yoghurt on the side (see Note 7 for Minted Yoghurt)
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooked-lamb-shanks-in-red-wine-sauce/, Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types – fan and standard). Season shanks – Pat the lamb shanks dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Brown – Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Sear the lamb shanks in 2 batches until brown all over; about 5 minutes. Remove lamb onto a plate and drain excess fat (if any) from the pot. Sauté aromatics – Turn the heat down to medium low. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the same pot. Add the onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add carrot and celery. Cook for 5 minutes until onion is translucent and sweet. Braising liquid – Add the red wine; chicken stock; crushed tomato; tomato paste; thyme and bay leaves. Stir to combine. Add shanks – Place the lamb shanks into the pot; squeezing them in to fit so they are mostly submerged. (Note 1) Oven 2 hours covered – Turn stove up; bring liquid to a simmer.  Cover; then transfer to the oven for 2 hours (see notes for other cook methods). Uncovered 30 minutes – Remove lid; then return to the oven for another 30 minutes (so 2 1/2 hours in total). Check to ensure lamb meat is ultra tender – if not; cover and keep cooking. Ideal is tender meat but still just holding onto bone. Remove lamb onto plate and keep warm. Pick out and discard bay leaves and thyme. Sauce – Strain the sauce into a bowl; pressing to extract all sauce out of the veggies (Note 5 for repurposing the veggies). Pour strained sauce back into pot. If needed; bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce slightly to a syrupy consistency (see video) – I rarely need to. Taste then add salt and pepper to taste (Note 5 on sauce taste).  Serve the lamb shanks on mashed potato or cauliflower puree with plenty of sauce! Garnish with thyme leaves if desired.

https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-movie-popcorn/, Place 3 tbsp Popcorn Butter in a large 10L/10qt lightweight pot over medium heat (medium high if weak stove). When the butter is almost melted; pour in Yellow Colouring; if using. Quickly give the pan a shake to disperse the colouring across the base. Add kernels; shake quickly to spread across the base; then clamp lid on. The kernels will start popping after a minute or so. Shake briefly once after 30 seconds or so. When the popping stops; immediately pour popcorn into a large bowl. Melt Extra Popcorn Butter in microwave. Pour over popcorn; sprinkle over salt. Shake and toss well to disperse. Extra fantastic served warm but still irresistible at room temp. Place in a mortar and pestle and grind into a fine powder. OR use about 1/2 cup salt and blitz in food processor. Place butter in a silver saucepan over medium low to medium heat. Leave to melt; it will start to sputter and spit; then foam. When you push the foam aside and you see brown bits on the bottom of the saucepan; remove from heat. Takes about 10 minutes. Line a strainer with 2 paper towels; then strain butter through – discard brown bits. Pour strained butter into a jar or container. It sets when it cools. Use in liquid or set form. Keeps in the pantry for months (it is now ghee / clarified butter). Mix ingredients in a small bowl until spices dissolve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-ham-bone-rice-soup-congee/, Place bone; rice and water in a large pot; slow cooker or pressure cooker. Cover with lid. Cook using preferred method (times below); or until meat on ham is tender enough to shred. Remove ham from soup; shred meat. Discard fatty / thick skin and sinew; keep bone. Use scissors if needed to chop meat. Stir rice well; then return meat AND bone into soup. Cook using preferred method; until rice is broken down and soup has a porridge like consistency – see video.  Remove bone. Stir vigorously; then adjust consistency with water if desired. Or simmer uncovered if necessary to thicken. Adjust salt to taste (I usually just need a pinch); add a dash of pepper. Serve rice soup garnished with green onions; a sprinkle of Asian Fried Shallots and drizzle of sesame oil. Storage tip: Return bone into the soup; it continues to add flavour. Stove: Simmer on low for 1 3/4 – 2 hours (no stirring); shred meat; then on low for 30 minutes; stirring every now and then. Slow Cooker: Low for 8 hours; shred meat; then low for 1 – 2 hours. Pressure Cooker: High for 50 minutes; shred meat; then high for 15 minutes or 20 minutes on sauté function.
https://www.recipetineats.com/marinated-beef-kabobs/, Cut the beef into 3.25cm / 1.3″ wide cubes. Mix Marinade in a bowl. Add beef. Marinate for 1 – 24 hours; minimum 20 minutes. Cut capsicum and onion into 3.25cm / 1.3″ wide squares. Thread beef (reserve Marinade); vegetables and mushrooms on each skewer. I use 2 pieces of vegetables between each piece of beef. Thread loosely – don’t smush together tightly (helps even cooking). Brush kebabs lightly with Reserved Marinade (including vegetables); then drizzle with olive oil. Heat BBQ or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tbsp oil; then when smoking; cook kebabs in batches for 2 minutes on each side until slightly charred (4 sides = 8 minutes in total); basting with Reserved Marinade as you go.

Serve with crusty bread; or pita bread.
https://www.recipetineats.com/char-kway-teow/, Mix Sauce together. Do not attempt to pull noodles apart while cold and hard – they break.  Place whole packet in microwave; heat on high for 1 1/2 minutes – 2 minutes until warm and pliable; not hot; turning packet over as needed. Handle carefully and measure out 500g/1 lb noodles into a heatproof bowl. Separate noodles stuck together. If noodles become cold and brittle before cooking; cover with cling wrap and microwave for 30 seconds to make warm (not hot; just warm) to reduce breakage. Cook using Base Recipe (capable cooks) or Easier Method. Heat lard and 1 tbsp oil in a wok or very large heavy based skillet over high heat. Swirl around the wok. When it starts smoking; add prawns. Cook for 30 seconds. Add garlic; stir for 10 seconds. Add noodles; then using both hands on the handle; toss 4 times until coated with oil (or gently fold using a spatula + wooden spoon; see video).

When heated; add shrimp and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until just cooked through; then remove into bowl Add Chinese sausage and fish cake; and cook for 1 minute until sausage is caramelised; then add to bowl. Add 1 tbsp oil then add egg and cook; pushing in the edges to make a thick omelette. Once set; chop it up roughly using a wooden spoon (see video); then add to bowl. Add bean sprouts and cook for about 1 minute until just starting to wilt; then add to bowl. Add lard. Once melted and starting to smoke; add garlic then immediately add noodles. Fold gently 4 times using a spatula + wooden spoon (see video) just to disperse oil through noodles. Tip all the other ingredients back in plus the chives. Fold gently twice; then pour all the Sauce over. Gently toss 4 to 6 times to disperse the sauce; pausing in between to allow the noodles to have a chance to caramelise on the edges a bit. Remove from stove and serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/strawberry-ice-cream-no-churn/, Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan) with shelf in the middle. Pile strawberries on a tray. Sprinkle over sugar. Toss through; then spread strawberries out on tray. Roast for 45 minutes; rotating tray halfway. Remove from oven; toss strawberries; then return to oven for 15 minutes. Keep an eye on it – don’t want juices to become toffee and stick to tray. Remove from oven; use spatula to scrape into a food processor; being sure to get all the juices and caramelised bits off the tray. Blitz until smooth as possible (caramelised bits won’t blitz smooth); scrape into bowl then cool completely. Add condensed milk and vanilla into strawberries. Beat well for 1 1/2 minutes on high to aerate and combine. Place cream in another bowl. Use electric beater to beat into stiff peaks – about 3 minutes on high. Add a dollop of cream into the strawberry mixture. Fold through gently; don’t beat in furiously (see video for technique). When mostly mixed through; add another dollop and for through about 5 times. Tip strawberry mixture into the cream bowl. Gently fold through until it’s a uniform pink colour – about 15 to 20 folds max. Some streaks is ok. Pour mixture into a container (preferably glass with airtight lid); smooth top. Place sheet of baking paper on surface and press out air bubbles (stops icicles forming). Cover with lid; freeze 12+ hours. Remove from freezer; remove paper. Scoop with ice cream scooper and serve in cones or bowls!

https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-apples/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Mix Filling ingredients together then set aside while you prep the apples – it will firm up and become scoopable (pop in fridge if its super hot where you are). Cut the apples in half through the core then use an ice cream scooper; spoon or small knife to scoop out the core (see video). Place apples in a baking dish so they are reasonably snug – you don’t want heaps of space around them. Pile Filling on the apples – I use an ice cream scoop. Mix cornflour with a splash of the water; mix to dissolve; then add remaining water. Pour around the apples. Cover with foil; bake 20 minutes. Remove foil; then bake a further 20 minutes until the crumb is deep golden and the apples are tender (but not sloppy soft) and there’s a syrupy caramel in the pan (it thickens a bit more when serving).

Whisk eggs; cream; salt and pepper. Cool skillet and lower heat to medium. Add butter; then when it foams; add egg. Immediately give it a few stirs (as though you’re making scrambled eggs) then when the base just starts to set; spread it all out to cover the base (see video). Wait 20 – 30 seconds; then use a rubber spatula to lift up the edge; tilt pan to make the egg run off the surface under the omelette. Repeat 2 or 3 times around the edges of the omelette. Sprinkle half the omelette with some of the cheese; top with mushrooms; sprinkle with thyme and parsley; top with remaining cheese. Cover with lid and cook for 30 seconds or until the underside is light golden and top is just set – cheese won’t melt.

Cook for 5 minutes or until mushrooms are lightly browned (they won’t caramelise as well as the first batch) and the base of the pot is brown. Add rice and a splash of broth.

Place lid on; bring to a simmer then turn down to medium low. Cook for 15 minutes or until there is no residual liquid (tilt pot to check). Remove from stove; remove lid; QUICKLY toss in reserved mushrooms and scallions; put lid back on. Leave for 10 minutes (do not skip this step!). Fluff rice using a fork or wooden spoon. OPTIONAL: Stir through more butter. 🙂 Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-garlic-muffins/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan). Place butter and garlic in a microwave proof bowl and melt in 30 second bursts. Mix. Brush a 12 hole standard muffin tin generously with butter; being sure to slather with some garlic. Reserve some butter to brush tops. Whisk Dry ingredients in a bowl. Whisk Wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour Wet into the Dry ingredients bowl. Mix 8 times. Add cheese; mix as few times as possible just to incorporate remaining bits of flour – no more than 7 big stirs (secret to soft muffs). Divide between 11 holes in muffin in (I use an ice cream scooper). Batter should be thick and fill muffin tin to top (if in ball shape due to scooper; leave as is). See video. Bake for 22 – 25 minutes or until the muffins are golden and crusty and spring back when touched in the centre. Remove onto cooling rack; brush with remaining butter (microwave again if needed) and cool slightly before getting stuck into them!
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-beef-brisket-with-bbq-sauce/, Mix Rub ingredients. Rub all over brisket. If time permits; leave for 30 minutes – 24 hours in the fridge; but I rarely do this. Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket – squish it in if needed; like I did (see video). Slow cook in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg / 3 lb) to 10 hours (2 kg / 4 lb). (Note 2 for pressure cooker and click here for oven) Remove brisket onto a tray. Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools). Meanwhile; drizzle brisket with oil then roast in a 200C/390F oven for 15 minutes until brown spots appear. Remove then baste generously with Sauce; then return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and baste again; then return to oven for 5 – 10 minutes until it caramelises and looks like the photos. (See note for BBQ option) TO SERVE: Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders. See Note 3 for more ideas.

https://www.recipetineats.com/prawn-risotto-shrimp/, Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy based pot over medium high heat. Spread half the prawns in a single layer; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 ½ minutes; then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove into bowl. Add a touch more oil and repeat with remaining prawns. Set aside and keep warm. Turn heat down to medium. Melt butter in pot then add onion and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes until translucent. Add wine; and stir; scraping the bottom of the pot to mix the brown bits from the prawn into the liquid. Bring to simmer and cook for 2 minutes until harsh alcohol smell is gone. Add rice and stir for 30 seconds until rice is translucent on edges. Add about 2/3 of the chicken broth. Stir; bring to simmer. Adjust heat so it’s simmering gently. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir; then simmer for a further 2 minutes until broth is mostly absorbed and rice is visible on the surface (see video and photos). Add remaining broth and milk. Stir; simmer for 3 minutes. Stir; simmer for 2 minutes. Risotto should be soupy and rice still a tiny bit undercooked. Add peas and parmesan; quickly stir. Taste; then add salt and pepper; then quickly stir. Add Extra Butter; then stir vigorously for 10 seconds (this is the step that makes it very creamy). Lastly; gently stir through prawns (tip in any juices too). Remove risotto from heat; it should be porridge-like. (Note 3; see video) To loosen; add hot tap water 2 tbsp at time and stir through. Give it a good final stir just before serving. Then ladle into bowls (it should ooze a bit; not be sticky lump). Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.

https://www.recipetineats.com/mexican-fiesta-menu/, Choose one or two proteins; then sides of choice. See linked recipes for directions (except tortilla chips and grilled corn; see below). Main Taco Filling Selection: The most convenient big batch protein is Pork Carnitas because it freezes great and only requires a quick pan fry to freshen up; and stays good for several hours (tips are in Carnitas recipe notes). The Shredded Chicken and Beef are almost as good (pork is slightly juicier) and stored similarly. The next simplest is Fish Tacos because it’s very quick to cook; then just put them in a serving dish and break into chunks with fork. If you want to use one of the chicken recipes to make ahead; use boneless thigh fillets; cook; then keep whole; cover and cool; reserve every drop of leached juice. Before serving; chop/slice; cover and microwave reheat. Taco Fixings: I like to have at least one fresh thing to stuff in tacos (pickled cabbage is my choice in this Fiesta); + a sauce (the Restaurant Style Salsa;) + avocado in some form (guac or slices or in Pico de Gallo) + coriander/cilantro. Chopped white onion is very common in Mexico; and Tex Mex fans such as myself will almost always have sour cream and shredded cheese too! Other Sides: Tortillas + things to stuff in tortillas usually makes for a satisfying meal in itself; but to round things out I usually provide a salad or vegetables of some form. Plain grilled corn is very on theme!  Homemade Tortillas Chips: Chop corn tortillas to desired shape; fry in oil until crisp and light golden. Transfer for paper towel; sprinkle with salt while hot. Grilled Corn: Grill corn on BBQ over high heat until nicely charred. Brush with melted salted butter and sprinkle with chipotle powder (or chilli or cayenne; to taste)

Transfer dough onto work surface; scrape out residual bits in the food processor. Knead lightly no more than 10 times just to bring the dough together into one smooth ball; then pat down into a 2 cm / 4/5″ thick disc. Dust with extra flour if necessary (I don’t need it). Optional: Lightly roll across the top with a rolling pin to smooth the top. Dip a 5 cm / 2″ round cutter into Extra Flour. Plunge cutter straight down and back out into dough – do not twist. Repeat all over disc.  Remove excess dough from around scones; then carefully transfer scones onto baking tray; taking care not to smear / press the cut sides. (Note 4) Gather together dough scraps and repeat. I get 10 scones in total. Brush tops lightly with milk. (Optional) Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the top is golden and it sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from oven; then transfer onto dish towel and wrap loosely (makes top soft). Once cooled to warm (10 – 15 minutes); serve warm. Tradition is to split the scone with hands (no knife!); slather with jam and dollop on cream. Whip cream; sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Makes 2 cups of whipped cream.

Squeeze out excess liquid from cabbage using hands. Filling: Place cabbage; mushrooms and remaining Filling ingredients in a bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. Peel one wrapper off and place on the palm of your left hand (if right handed). Dip your finger in water and run it along half the edge of the wrapper. Place 1 heaped tablespoon of Filling in the centre. Fold wrapper over; then pleat to seal. Alternatively; just press together with no pleats. Finish so the dumpling is curved slightly; see photos in post; with the pleats on the top. Place on tray. Cover with cling wrap or wet tea towel (important). Repeat with remaining dumplings. Should make 30; if yours are extremely plump you may only make 25. Make sure your pan has a lid that fits it half decently (Note 6). Heat 2 tsp oil in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Add dumplings; pressing down firmly to flatten the base onto the pan. Cook around 8 to 10 per batch. When the base is golden brown (check them); add 1/2 cup of water into the pan. Immediately clamp the lid on; then leave for 7 minutes (any less and the pleats won’t be cooked through so if your water dries out; add a bit more). Remove lid – most of the water should be evaporated; the pleats should be cooked through. Leave the pan on the stove until the base dries and the underside of the dumplings are once again crisp. Remove dumplings from pan and transfer to serving plate. Repeat with remaining Dumplings. Serve with Dipping Sauces of choice. (Note 7)
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-pie/, Push a clove into the skin of each onion. Place in a pot or large skillet; add milk; turn stove onto medium high heat. When milk is barely simmering; add fish – don’t worry if it’s not entirely covered; it can be turned / moved around. Poach fish for 7 minutes; then use a slotted spoon to transfer fish straight into a medium baking dish (Note 8). Flake into chunks using forks. Remove bones if you see any. Use slotted spoon to remove onion and cloves from milk; discard. RESERVE milk. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Boil water for potatoes. Melt butter in a large; deep skillet or pot over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Then add celery and carrot; cook for 5 minutes until carrot is soft. Turn heat down to medium low. Add flour; mix in – it will look gluey. Add half the milk and quickly start mixing. Once incorporated; the mixture will thicken quickly. Add remaining milk and stir. (Video helpful here) Turn heat up to medium and keep stirring until the mixture thickens to the consistency of honey – about 3 minutes. (Note 7) Take it off the heat; stir through tarragon and parsley. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Scatter top of flaked fish with peas; then pour over the Sauce. GENTLY stir through (don’t want fish to turn into mush!).* Smooth top; then nestle egg in all over the pie. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add potatoes and cook for 15 minutes or until soft. (Do this while making the Sauce). Drain potato; add butter; milk; salt and pepper. Mash until creamy – add more milk if required. Immediately dollop then spread onto pie (cold mash = hard to spread). Use fork to draw squiggles on surface (rough surface = better golden bits). Drizzle surface with melted butter; sprinkle with parmesan. Bake for 35 minutes or until top is deep golden. Stand for 5 minutes before serving; garnished with parsley if desired. See notes for reheating and make ahead.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-cake/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan/convection). Grease a 20 cm / 8” cake pan with butter. Place Wet ingredients in a bowl.

Bake for 50 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean. Remove metal ring and cool on rack then glaze. Place ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Test down the side of the bowl to get the right thickness; using 1 tsp of yoghurt at a time to thin it out if required. Glaze should drip (slowly; because it’s thick) but not be see through. Place rack on a tray or baking paper. Pour glaze over the middle of the cake; gently push towards the edges so it drips down the sides. Let it set for 1 hour before transferring to a serving plate. See note for how I did the lemon slices in the photos; and the alternative quick Cream Cheese Frosting.

Place lid on; place tea towel on lid and hold down very firmly; then whizz to puree soup; starting on low then getting faster. Remove lid. Marvel at super low cal ultra creamy soup broth. Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Then add carrots and celery; cook for 2 minutes. Add thyme; capsicum and zucchini. Cook until softened; around 2 minutes. Pour in soup broth. Adjustment consistency with water to achieve desired thickness. Add reserved cauliflower. Simmer 5 minutes to bring flavours together. Season with salt and pepper. Serve; garnished with parsley. Or splurge your calorie credits on a piece of grilled cheese to dunk into the soup!!
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-smashed-potatoes/, Cook potatoes: Bring a pot of water to the boil; add 1 tbsp salt. Cook potatoes until soft – small ones should take around 20 to 25 minutes; medium ones might take 30 minutes. It's ok if the skin splits. Alternatively; steam or microwave them. Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). Steam dry: Drain the potatoes and let them dry in the colander for 5 minutes or so. Smash! Place on the tray then use a large fork or potato masher to squish them; keeping them in one piece. Thin = crisper. Thicker = fluffier insides. (Both good!) More nubbly surface = better crunch! Steam dry again: Leave on the tray to steam dry for 5 minutes or so – makes them crispier! Drizzle: Drizzle with butter; then olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake: Bake for 45 minutes (small potatoes) to 55 minutes (medium) or until deep golden and crispy. Do not flip! Serve hot; sprinkled with parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sesame-crusted-salmon/, Take salmon out of fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Preheat oven to 220C/430F (standard) or 200C/390F (fan). Place shelf about 20cm/8″ from the broiler heat source at the top of the oven. Sprinkle both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper. Place sesame in shallow dish. Press salmon into sesame seeds to coat on all sides. Place on tray. Drizzle top with oil. Bake for 10 minutes. Flick to broiler on high – broil / grill for 3 minutes until the top is a bit golden (or bake for 5 minutes; but won’t be as golden). (Note 5) Remove from oven; rest 3 minutes. Serve with soba and greens; garnished with scallions (optional) and drizzled with Dressing. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Cook soba per packet directions. Add greens for the last 1 minute of cooking. Drain then divide between bowls. Place ingredients in jar and shake. Set aside for 5 minutes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheesy-zucchini-bread-no-yeast/, Use a standard box grater to grate the zucchini. Measure out 2 cups; place in bowl; sprinkle with salt; use fingers to disperse. Leave for 20 minutes. Squeeze handfuls to remove excess water and place zucchini in a bowl. Set aside. Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F (all oven types). Butter and line a loaf pan (Note 3) Place Dry ingredients in a bowl. Whisk to combine. Place Wet Ingredients in a bowl. Whisk to combine. Make a well in the centre of the Dry ingredients. Pour in Wet. Mix quickly until flour is incorporated (Note 4). Quickly stir through zucchini. Spread 1/3 of the batter in the loaf pan. Top with 4 slices of cheese. Spread with batter; top with 4 slices of cheese; then finish with remaining batter. Smooth top. Bake for 50 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Optional: Brush top with a bit of melted butter. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then transfer to rack to cool. Cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing. Store in a container (Note 5 for humid weather warning!)
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooked-lamb-shawarma/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan forced / convection). Place Paste ingredients in a bowl; starting with 2 tbsp lemon juice; and mix. It should be a wet paste that can be slathered onto the lamb (see video). Place lamb in a large roasting pan. Slather all over with paste. Optional: Marinate 24 hours (not mandatory; I usually skip). Position the lamb with the fat side up. Pour water around; cover tightly with foil. Roast 3 hours; removing from the oven 2 – 3 times to spoon over pan juices (ie baste). Remove foil. Meat should be tender – check with 2 forks. Baste again; then return to oven for 30 minutes to get a nice crust. Remove lamb from roasting pan – reserve juices. Cool the lamb for 20 minutes or so (so it firms up slightly; easier to handle). If you used shoulder; pull the meat off the bone in 4 or 5 chunks (see video). Preheat BBQ to medium and oil if required. Coat lamb in pan juices. Sear on both sides until deep golden and a crust forms. Dab with pan juices on both sides. Slice or shred lamb; as desired. Drizzle with plenty of juices. Make Lamb Shawarma wraps by serving with shredded lettuce; tomatoes and minted yoghurt (Note 3) or pile over Lemon Herbed Couscous (Note 4) and garnish with pomegranate seeds and parsley or chopped coriander/cilantro (if desired). Both pictured in post.
https://www.recipetineats.com/parmesan-crusted-chicken-breast/, Cut each breast in half horizontally to make 4 steaks. If they are much thicker than 1.75 cm / 3/4″ thick (at the thickest point); pound a bit. Place egg; garlic; pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl. Whisk with fork. Place parmesan in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken in egg; then place in parmesan CUT SIDE DOWN (Note 3). Press; then turn. Coat with extra parmesan; press. Shake off excess. Repeat with remaining chicken. Melt butter and heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place chicken in non-stick skillet (or well seasoned cast iron skillet). DO NOT MOVE chicken otherwise the cheese will slide off surface before it adheres! It adheres once it turns crispy. Press down lightly with spatula. Lift a corner to take a peek and turn with tongs when it’s deep golden brown (3 minutes for me).  Cook the other side for 3 minutes or until also deep golden brown and crispy (again; do not move until golden). Lightly press down with spatula. Don’t cook longer than 6 minutes in total – dries out the chicken. Serve immediately! I served mine with lemon slices; Cauliflower Mash  and a Fennel Slaw with Yoghurt Dressing (Note 5).
https://www.recipetineats.com/no-bake-mango-cheesecake/, Use a 22 cm / 9″ springform pan (or similar size). Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (for ease of removal later). Place a square sheet of baking paper on the base; then secure in springform pan (see video) with excess paper hanging out sides. Grease sides with butter and line with paper. Blitz crackers into fine crumbs in a food processor. Add butter and sugar; blitz until combined. Pour into prepared cake pan. Press down firmly – base only; not sides. Put water in a heatproof bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over surface (don’t dump in centre). Stir to partly dissolve. Set aside 5 minutes – it turns gelatinous. Microwave 15 seconds on high x 2; stirring in between. Stir until dissolved (few tiny specks ok). Cool 5 minutes. Place mango in food processor. Blitz until smooth. Measure out 3/4 cup and reserve for mango jelly; set aside. Add cream cheese; cream; sugar and gelatine mixture into food processor (2.5L/2.5qt/10 cup+ capacity – Note 3). Blitz for 30 seconds or so until smooth. Pour into cake pan. Refrigerate 3+ hours until top is set. Pour water into bowl; sprinkle over gelatin. Leave 5+ min. Microwave on high 2 x 10 sec; stir well until granules dissolved. Set aside 5 minutes to cool. Place reserved mango puree (from step 4 under Filling) and lemon in a bowl. Pour over gelatin and whisk well. Pour over cheesecake filling. Tilt cake around to spread. Refrigerate 12 hours+. Release pan sides; then use overhang paper to slide cheesecake onto serving plate. Then slide the paper out from under the cheesecake. Place cream; vanilla and sugar in a bowl. Whip until the cream is softy whipped. Piled over the centre of the cheesecake. Top with more chopped mango and passionfruit pulp. Serve and relish in praises!
https://www.recipetineats.com/salisbury-steak-with-mushroom-gravy/, Onion grating – Place breadcrumbs in a bowl. Use a box grater and grate the onion over the breadcrumbs. Mix with fingers; leave to soak for a few minutes.  Mix – Add remaining Salisbury Steak ingredients into the large bowl. Use your hands to mix until just combined. Mix well for a couple of minutes until the mixture becomes a bit "pasty" which will ensure your patties hold together well. Form patties – Divide into 5 and pat very firmly into oval patties around 3/4" / 1 2/3 cm thick. Brown patties – Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the steaks and cook the first side for 1 minute or until browned; then gently flip and brown the other side (they will still be raw inside). Remove onto plate. Cook aromatics – If skillet is looking dry; add a touch more oil. Add chopped onion and garlic and cook for 2 minute until onions are a bit translucent. Cook mushrooms – Add the mushrooms into the skillet and cook for 2 – 3 minutes until golden. Make gravy roux – Turn heat down to medium. Add butter. Once melted; add flour and cook for 30 seconds; stirring constantly. Gravy – Gradually add in beef broth; stirring as you go. Once mostly lump free; whisk in remaining Gravy ingredients.  Finish cooking steaks – Add steaks along with the juices on the plate. Cook for 5 – 7 minutes; or until gravy is thickened; stirring occasionally around the steaks. If the gravy thickens too quickly; add more water. Season gravy – Remove steaks onto a plate. Taste gravy and adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serve salisbury steaks topped with the mushroom gravy – over mashed potato is ideal! Sprinkle with a bit of parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-garlic-marinated-pork-chops/, Whisk Marinade ingredients in a bowl (or ziplock bag). Add pork. Marinade for 1 hr minimum; 3 hours ideal; 12 hours max (Note 3). Take the pork out of the fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Shake excess marinade off (but don’t wipe dry) and cook using preferred method. Pictured in post served with Minted Yoghurt – see notes! Brush grills / plate with oil and heat on high until smoking. Place pork on grills and cook the first side for 4 minutes until it is nicely charred. Turn and cook the other side for 3 minutes.  Turn the porks on their side to briefly sear the fat side (see video). Transfer to plate; rest for 3 – 5 minutes then serve. Heat skillet with about 1 tbsp oil over high heat. Add pork and cook for 1 minute; then turn DOWN slightly to medium high. Cook for another 3 minutes; then turn and cook the other side for 3 minutes. Turn the porks on their side to briefly sear the fat side (see video). Transfer to plate; rest for 3 – 5 minutes then serve. Preheat oven to 200C / 390F (fan forced / convection) or 220C / 430F (standard oven). Place oven shelf in top 1/3 of oven. Place pork on tray. Bake for 15 minutes; then flick to grill/broiler and grill on high for 5 minutes until the surface is nicely browned. Transfer to plate; rest for 3 – 5 minutes then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/smoked-salmon-dip/, Place all ingredients in a food processor; starting with 1 tbsp lemon juice. Only use a small pinch of salt to start because smoked salmon is salty; also bear in mind saltiness of crackers being used. Whizz until fairly smooth – about 10 seconds on high – scraping sides as required. Adjust lemon and salt to taste. Whizz again briefly. Transfer into bowl; garnish with lemon slices and more dill if desired. Serve at room temperature with crackers – I like using melba toasts and mini crostinis.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-ham-pancakes/, Place flour; baking powder; salt and pepper in a bowl. Mix to combine. Make a well in the centre. Add egg and milk. Mix until flour is incorporated – small lumps is fine (see video / photo in post). Add cheese; ham and shallots. Stir through – it should have a soft dropping consistency. Heat a non stick pan over medium high heat (or medium if your stove is strong). If using extra ham for toppings: cook it in just 1 tsp butter until golden; then remove onto paper towels to drain. For the pancakes: Add about 2 tsp butter; swirl to melt. Place 1/4 cup batter in the pan (Note 4); then roughly spread into a 7cm / 3″ circle. Repeat to fill the pan (I do 3 in a small pan; 4 in a large). Cook for 2 minutes until the underside is deep golden. Don’t wait for bubbles like normal pancakes; they won’t appear. Flip and cook the other side for 1 1/2 minutes. Remove onto a rack. Add a bit of extra butter and repeat with remaining batter. Serve with dollops of sour cream (virtually mandatory!); sprinkled with extra cooked ham and shallots; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/5-great-prawn-dipping-sauces/, Place ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. Adjust salt to taste (Note 3). Place all ingredients except coriander in a bowl; whisk well. Stir through coriander and add salt and pepper to taste. Rest 20 minutes before using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/christmas-trifle/, Cut cake into 2 cm / 0.8" cubes. Cover bottom of 3.5 L / 3.5 qt trifle dish with cake (might not use all) and sprinkle with liquor or juice.  Optional extra: Scatter over 1/2 to 1 punnet halved strawberries (this is not in ingredients list). Heat half juice – Put half the cranberry juice into a saucepan over medium heat (3 cups / 750ml). Bring to a simmer; then turn off stove. Dissolve geatline – Meanwhile; put remaining room temperature cranberry juice into a very large bowl. Sprinkle gelatine all across surface (don't dump in one place; else you get lumps). Whisk until mostly dissolved (will finish dissolving in next step). Pour in hot cranberry juice. Whisk until gelatin is fully dissolved.  Pour HALF the warm jelly liquid carefully down the side of the trifle dish so the cake pieces are submerged. Refrigerate the trifle dish uncovered for 1 1/2 hours until it is partly set. It needs to be set enough so you can gently place a strawberry on it and it will stay on the surface. Proceed to Custard Layer steps. Pour remaining warm jelly in a bowl and leave on the counter. DO NOT refrigerate. Meanwhile; make the custard so it is ready to use (see below for how to make). Remove trifle from fridge. Whisk the room temperature custard to loosen. Spoon onto the jelly; smooth surface; press against wall of glass to seal (stops jelly bleed so you get neat layers). Refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour until the surface has firmed up a bit – just enough to hold the jelly (jelly is soft; so custard doesn't need to be fully set).  Give the remaining jelly a good whisk then put it in the fridge at the same time to thicken a bit but not fully set. Refrigerate for 1 hour; but check at 30 minutes to ensure it isn't setting too fast. The jelly should be sloppy but spoonable; scoops up in a small mound. If it fully sets; you'll end up with a "broken glass" effect on the next jelly layer rather than a clear layer (read Note 5).  Remove trifle and jelly from fridge. Jelly should be sloppy. Carefully spoon over jelly; smooth surface. Scatter over 1 punnet halved strawberries (or half each raspberries and strawberries). Refrigerate for 3 hours+ (can leave in fridge for 48 hours; until ready to assemble). Cream: Beat cream; sugar and vanilla until softly whipped. Once jelly is set; just before serving; top with cream; then pile over remaining berries. Dust with icing sugar.  Serve!! PS It is imperative to ensure every servings includes a bit of every layer in the trifle 😂 Bring milk; ¼ cup sugar and vanilla to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Do not boil. In a large bowl; whisk together remaining ¼ cup sugar and yolks; then whisk in cornflour until smooth. While whisking; carefully pour in about ½ cup of milk mixture. Once mixed in; slowly pour in remaining milk while whisking. Once incorporated and smooth; pour back into saucepan. Return saucepan to stove over low heat. Whisk constantly until it becomes thick and custardy – this will happen quite quickly; about 45 seconds (ie it is liquidy when you start; then suddenly it thickens). Once thickened; remove immediately from heat (it will continue to thicken as it cools). Immediately pour into a bowl and cover with cling wrap; pressing onto surface. Leave on the counter to cool to room temp until trifle is ready to layer with custard. Makes 750ml. (Note 5)
https://www.recipetineats.com/never-ending-meringue-tart/, Preheat oven to 120C/250F (standard) or 100C/210F (fan/convection). Mark 2 rectangles 11 x 40 cm / 4.5 x 15″ on a sheet of baking paper using pencil; with 2.5cm / 1″ between each outline. Repeat with another sheet of paper (so 4 outlines). Find 2 baking trays large enough so the outline fits on the tray surface when the tray is turned upside down (rim gets in way of piping). Fit a large piping bag with a 11mm / 0.5" round nozzle. (Ziplock: Note 2) Separate the egg whites while the eggs are fridge cold. Place whites in a large clean; dry bowl. Whip until it all turns into foam and there’s no liquid whites left (1 minute on speed 8 with KitchenAide). With the beater still going; add the sugar one heaped tablespoon at a time – about 1 minute. After the sugar is added; crank the beater up to speed 10 and whip for 1 minute. Fluff should be glossy and when you rub between fingers; there should be barely any sugar grit – a bit is ok. Spoon half the meringue into piping bag (Note 3). Dab small amount on the corner of an upside down baking tray. Place paper on tray pencil marking side down. Pipe filling inside the lines – don’t worry if there are gaps (loads in my video). Use dessert spoon to smooth surface – the base should be about 1/2 cm thick (rises to ~7 mm cooked). Pipe blobs along one short end (to make tart ends) and all along both long sides. Do this to both on Tray 1. Place in oven. Repeat with remaining meringues on Tray 2; but do not pipe blobs along the short end (these will be the middle pieces). Place in oven on shelf just below Tray 1. Use any remaining meringue to make extra small blobs (good for repairs / decoration / nibbling). Place this tray on the floor of oven. Bake for 45 minutes; then swap the two trays (tray with blobs not a priority; leave it!). Bake for further 30 minutes; then turn off the oven; keep door closed and leave to cool (can keep in oven even for days). Meringue should be dry and crisp; able to lift off paper. Place cream; vanilla and sugar in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Trim joining ends of meringues with knife so they are straight. Dab cream on cut end and join meringues. Assemble where you plan to serve. Spread over cream; top with fruit; dust with sugar. Serve immediately; and puff up with pride when lavished with compliments!
https://www.recipetineats.com/oven-baked-chicken-and-rice-pilaf-cranberry-walnut-apple/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan/convection). Use a baking dish about 22 x 33cm / 9 x 13″. Scatter onion and garlic in baking dish; dollop butter over. Bake for 15 minutes; then remove. If your chicken has skin on it; remove it (just pull it off). Otherwise; the rice will be too greasy. Whisk together Sticky Chicken Glaze. Add chicken; turn to coat. Add rice; apple juice; chicken broth and Rice Herbs into the pan with the onion. Stir. Add cranberries and walnuts. Stir. Top with chicken – it will be partly submerged. Save glaze in bowl. Cover with foil. Bake 20 minutes. Remove foil – don’t worry if there’s still liquid (Note 4). Spoon all remaining Glaze onto chicken. Optional: spray with oil (gives chicken a slightly nicer finish). Bake for another 30 – 35 minutes until chicken is browned. Remove pan from oven. Rest 5 minutes. Remove chicken; add apple; then use fork to fluff rice. Serve chicken with rice pilaf; garnished with fresh parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lamb-shawarma-chickpea-soup/, Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 1 minute until starting to turn translucent. Add lamb and cook; breaking it up as you go. When it has mostly turned from pink to light brown; add spices. Cook for 1 minute; then add tomato paste and cook for another 1 minute. (It smells amazing!) Add carrots; chickpeas;  tomato and broth. Stir and bring to simmer. Cover with lid; lower heat so it is bubbling energetically but not crazy rapidly. Cook for 10 minutes until carrot is tender but not super soft – I like it to have a bit of bite still; if you want super soft; keep cooking. Stir through spinach. Once wilted; adjust salt; pepper and spiciness (cayenne) to taste; and water if you want more liquid. Ladle into bowls; add a dollop of yoghurt and a generous sprinkling of coriander. Enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-gourmet-crackers-with-cranberries/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all oven types). Grease and line a small loaf tin with baking paper (mine is 21 x 11 x 7 cm / 8.5 x 4.5 x 3”) (Note 1). Whisk the milk; sugar and yoghurt in a bowl. In a separate bowl; add plain flour; wholemeal flour and cranberries. Stir – use fingers to break up cranberries if required. Add remaining ingredients; including Spices; plus the milk mixture. It should be a thick batter; like muffin batter (note: batter in video looks slightly thicker because it was standing for a couple of minutes; doesn’t affect outcome).  Scrape/pour into tin. Bake for 25 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool on rack; then wrap in cling wrap and freeze for at least 2 hours; up to 3 months. (Note 2) Unwrap loaf and allow to thaw partially so the outside is not rock hard frozen (around 20 minutes). Preheat oven to 120C/250F (all oven types). Place one shelf in the middle; and another shelf beneath it. Use a serrated bread knife to slice thinly – around 2 mm / 1/12” thick (see video). Place biscuits on 2 large baking trays; you can squeeze them in as they won’t expand or stick. Bake for 50 minutes or until they are a light brown; swapping trays halfway. Leave biscuits on tray to cool – they will harden so they snap when you break them. (Note 3) Store in an airtight container for 4 weeks (probably ok for longer; I’ve only done 4 weeks). Brilliant served with creamy cheeses like brie; camembert; but soft; creamy blue cheeses is the ultimate pairing!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cocktail-meatballs-with-sweet-sour-dipping-sauce/, Preheat oven to 220C / 430F (standard) or 200C / 390F (fan / convection). Grate onion into a large bowl using a standard box grater. Add breadcrumbs and mix to coat. Leave to soak for a few minutes. Add remaining Meatballs ingredients. Mix well with your hands until combined. Measure out level tablespoons and dollop onto work surface. Roll into balls. (My way of rolling balls – fast!) Place a rack on a baking tray (optional; Note 3). Spray rack generously with oil. Place balls on the rack. Bake for 25 minutes or until browned. Remove tray from oven; immediately transfer meatballs in a large bowl (if you leave them; they stick). Drizzle with enough sauce to coat the meatballs. Toss gently; then transfer to serving bowl / plate. Garnish with chives; if desired. Serve meatballs with toothpicks and remaining Sauce for Dipping. Combine ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk to combine. Bring to simmer; stirring / whisking regularly; then simmer until it thickens to a syrup consistency – or thicker if you like. (about 3 minutes) Pour meatballs in a bowl; pour a bit of sauce to coat. Serve with remaining sauce; garnished with chives.
https://www.recipetineats.com/blueberry-lemon-yoghurt-cake/, Preheat oven to 200C / 390F (standard) or 180C / 350F (fan / convection). Grease a 22 cm / 9” springform pan with butter; line base with baking paper. Rinse blueberries; shake off excess water (but don’t pat dry). Set aside about 1/3 of the blueberries (for topping cake). Toss remaining blueberries in flour; set aside. Whisk Wet in a large bowl. Add flour and salt; sprinkle over baking powder. Whisk until just combined – few small lumps is fine. Stir through blueberries (including loose flour in bowl). Pour into pan; top with remaining blueberries. Place in oven; TURN DOWN to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan/convection). Bake 50 minutes or until skewer comes out clean. Remove sides of springform pan and cool on a rack; then once cool remove the base. Sprinkle with icing sugar (powdered sugar). Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/prawn-mango-and-avocado-salad-with-noodles-and-lime-dressing/, Soak vermicelli noodles in freshly boiled water; per packet directions. Drain then set aside to cool. Place Dressing ingredients except coriander in a bowl. Whisk well. Stir through coriander. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Place avocado and mango in a bowl. Drizzle over 3 teaspoons of Dressing; GENTLY toss. Place 4 to 5 lettuce leaves on each plate; overlapping slightly (see video for how I do it). Divide the noodles between each plate. Then spoon over mango avocado salsa; sprinkle each plate all over with red onion and top with prawns. Drizzle over remaining Dressing all over everything; including the noodles. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-chicken-doner-kebab/, Mix Marinade in a large bowl. Add chicken and mix to coat well. Cover and marinate in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours; 24 hours is ideal. If only 3 hours; add an extra 1/2 tsp salt. Preheat oven to 220C / 430F (standard) or 200C / 390F (fan / convection). Choose a pan of a size such that the skewers will stay propped up on the pan walls (see photos in post or video) and the chicken will be elevated off the base. Line with foil. Remove chicken from fridge. Divide the chicken into 2 piles. Take one piece of chicken; fold in half then thread onto two skewers (see video). Repeat and push the chicken snugly up against each other. Repeat with other skewer. Prop the 2 skewers on the edges of the baking pan. Drizzle surface with oil. Bake for 35 minutes or until the surface is golden with some charred bits (char is good!). Spoon the pan juices over the chicken. Then turn; drizzle with oil and bake for 20 minutes (or 25 – 30 minutes if you had large thighs). If you need / want more colour; switch to grill/broil for a few minutes on high – I don’t do this. Baste again with pan juices and stand for 5 minutes. Carving: Stand the skewers upright or on an angle; and slice meat fairly thinly. Use to make Doner Kebabs or Kebab Plates. Place a  lebanese bread (or pita bread or other flatbread) on a piece of foil. Spread with a generous dollop of Hummus (or yoghurt – Note 2). Top with shredded lettuce; slices of tomato; Tabbouleh (for a truly authentic experience! Note 3); cheese (I usually go this) and Chicken. Drizzle with chilli sauce if desired (I use Sriracha; it’s perfect). Roll up tightly and wrap in foil. Consume and be happy! Serve chicken with Mejadra (Middle Eastern Spiced Rice with Lentils); shredded lettuce; tomatoes; slices of red onion; tabbouleh; dollop of hummus. Optional to serve flatbread / lebanese bread on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-roast-lamb-leg/, Place lamb in slow cooker or on work surface. Sprinkle with salt; pepper; thyme or rosemary and garlic. Drizzle over oil; then rub on both sides. Pour beef stock into slow cooker; add sprig of rosemary (if using). SLOW COOK on low for 10 hours; or pressure cook on high for 1 hour 40 minutes. (See oven version here) The lamb should be tender enough to pull off with tongs; but still holding together (just!). Carefully remove lamb from slow cooker and transfer to tray. Drizzle lightly with oil (any). Bake at 200C/390F for 20 minutes or until browned. Remove and rest for 10 minutes before serving with gravy. Strain liquid in slow cooker into a bowl – you will have more than the 2 cups of broth you added; I usually have over 3 cups. Measure out 2 cups of liquid; reserve remaining liquid just in case. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Add a bit of liquid; mixing as you go so it dissolves. Then add remaining liquid. Whisk if there are lumps. Increase to medium high heat and cook; stirring regularly; until thickened to your taste. Use remaining liquid to thin if required.
https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-herb-butter-roasted-turkey-breast/, Remove fridge chill: Take turkey out of the fridge 45 minutes before cooking (or 30 minutes if it's super hot where you are). Preheat oven to 200C / 390F (all oven types). Put rack in the lower middle position. (Note 3) Place garlic and bunch of herbs in the middle of a baking dish. (Note 4) Butter: Mix Butter ingredients together. Loosen skin: Use an upside teaspoon to help loosen the skin from the turkey flesh (easiest to go under the paper thin layer under the surface skin). Video helpful here. Smear butter under skin: Use about 2/3 of the butter; and smear it under the skin on the top half of the breast. Best to smear using hands under the skin (not on surface); to ensure it spreads as evenly as possible. Turn turkey upside down. Reserve about 2 tbsp butter for the surface; smear the rest on the underside. Place turkey in pan on the herbs; skin side up. Now smear skin with remaining butter –  you don’t want much on the skin because the herb bits burn.  STOP HERE for make ahead option – the turkey can be left like this for up to 24 hours. Remove from fridge 45 minutes before serving then proceed. Sprinkle top and sides of breast with salt and pepper all over. Place turkey in oven; turn DOWN to 180C/350F. Roast for 1 hr 30 minutes; basting all over every 30 minutes.  (Note 5) COOK TIME / INTERNAL TEMPERATURE: The turkey is cooked when the meat thermometer inserted at the thickest part is 74C/165F. I check in several places. Allow 15 minutes per 500g/1 lb of turkey. My 2.8 kg / 5.5lb bone in turkey took 1 hr 40 minutes. COVER turkey with foil when it becomes golden to your taste; at any point during the cook time (1 hr 15 minutes for me). Rest – Remove turkey from pan and place on serving plate. Cover loosely with foil and rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. The pan will have melted butter and roasting juices. Remove herbs and garlic; squeezing out juices. Pour sauce into jug; serve with turkey. Gravy option – see Note 11. I personally love using the butter; but I understand if you feel the need for gravy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/wild-rice-salad/, Boil 1 litre/quart+ of water in large saucepan (no need to be exact). Add rice; lower heat so it’s simmering gently. Cover then cook for 40 minutes (Note 4); or until rice is tender but not super soft (some will burst).  Drain then leave to steam dry and cool. Salad Shake Dressing in a jar; set aside for 15 minutes+. Place rocket; rice; cranberries; pecans and green onions in a bowl. Add some of the feta and pomegranate. Pour over most of the Dressing; toss gently. Transfer into serving bowl; top with remaining feta and pomegranate. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pecan-pie/, Place flour; salt and sugar in a food processor. Pulse twice. Scatter over butter. Pulse 5 times or until the largest pieces are the size of peas. Turn food processor on low and add 2.5 tbsp water; keep blitzing for 7 to 10 seconds until it forms crumbly clumps (see video). Pinch with your fingers – it should come together – if not; add 1/2 tbsp water until it does. Don’t blitz longer than 20 seconds. Turn out crumbs onto work surface; use hands to bring together into a ball then pat into a 1.5cm / 1/2″ thick disc. Wrap in cling wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) / 160C / 320F (fan / convection). Scatter 1 1/4 cups pecans on baking tray and bake for 3 to 5 minutes or until you smell them. Remove from oven and roughly chop. Set aside. Remaining 1 1/4 cups don’t need toasting – they are for the top. Dust work surface with flour. Place dough on work surface; dust top with flour. Roll out into 25cm/12″ circle; patching up cracks as required. Remember: the crumblier the dough; the more flaky your pastry which is GOOD! Roll the pastry onto your rolling pin; then roll it out onto a 22cm / 9″ pie tin. Press in; then trim edges with scissors with a 1cm / 0.3″ overhang. Turn the edges under and press down neatly. Crimp if desired (see video). Place 2 large pieces of baking paper over the pie crust then fill with pie weights or dried beans or rice. Weight is essential to avoid shrinking pastry. Bake 20 minutes; then remove pie weights and let the pastry cool for 5 minutes before filling. Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add remaining Filling ingredients and whisk until smooth. Stir through chopped pecans. Pour into crust – it should fill it about 1 cm / 2/5″ from the top (you may have excess if your pastry shrank). Top with whole pecans in desired pattern. Place pie in oven. Bake for 50 minutes; checking at 40 minutes; until it doesn’t jiggle much when you shake it but the centre is still soft when you touch it (see video). It will be puffed and cracks will look extreme; but it will deflate as it cools. If your pastry / pecans are browning too quickly; cover with foil. Cool completely before serving; to allow the custard to set – 2 – 4 hours. Slice; and serve with ice cream or cream if desired – I don’t need either! Store in an airtight container – great for 2 days; but I’m perfectly happy with mine even after 4.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-honey-glazed-salmon/, Place the Seasoning ingredients in a small dish and mix. Coat salmon in the Seasoning; shaking off excess well. Place oil and about 1 tsp of the butter in a large non stick skillet over medium high heat. Once the butter is melted; add the salmon. Cook salmon for 3 minutes; or until it’s a beautiful bronzed golden brown. Turn and cook for 1 minute. Add remaining butter; garlic and honey. Swirl the mixture around the pan as the butter melts. Simmer for 1 minute – the honey butter mixture will start to bubble like caramel and turn golden. Add lemon juice; shake pan to disperse. Taste sauce – adjust salt; pepper and lemon to taste. Turn salmon over to coat in the sauce; then remove from heat immediately. Place salmon on plates and drizzle over sauce. Garnish with parsley and fresh lemon; if desired
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-chicken-salad/, Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Boil water in a saucepan. Add chicken; put the lid on; let the water come back up to a simmer; then remove from stove. Set aside for 20 minutes (even up to 45 min is fine). (Note 4) Remove chicken from water and shred; then cool. Place ingredients in a jar. Shake well. Taste and adjust as required. It should be a balance of tangy / sweet / salty / hint of spice. (Note 5) Place Salad ingredients in a large bowl. Drizzle over most of the Dressing; toss. Serve immediately; drizzled with remaining Dressing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-garlic-prawn-pasta/, Bring to boil a large pot of water. Add pasta and cook per packet MINUS 1 minute. (Note 5). Just before draining; scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain pasta. Meanwhile; melt 1 tbsp of butter in a large non stick skillet over medium high heat. Add prawns and cook for 1 1/2 minutes on each side until just cooked through. Remove prawns. In the same skillet; add 1 tbsp butter. Once melted; add garlic. Stir for 20 seconds until fragrant. Add wine and stir. Simmer for 2 minutes until wine mostly reduces (see video). Add cream; broth and parmesan. Stir until the parmesan is melted; then leave to simmer for 1 1/2 minutes until it thickens slightly (will thicken more in next step). Add prawns; stir; then add pasta plus about 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water. Toss pasta (still on stove) and the sauce will thicken in about 30 – 45 seconds and start clinging to the pasta. Take it off the stove before the sauce is as thick as you want – it will thicken more. Sprinkle with most of the parsley and black pepper; check salt (I don’t need more). Toss again until the sauce consistency is to your taste. Add a tiny splash of pasta water if it gets too gluggy. Serve immediately; garnished with remaining parsley and parmesan if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mexican-red-rice/, Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; stir briefly; then add onion. Cook for 4 – 5 minutes until translucent (not browned / golden). Add rice; broth; salt and tomato paste. Stir until tomato paste is dissolved. Plonk in jalapeno and coriander. Cover; bring to simmer; then lower heat to low so the water is simmering gently. Cook for 15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed (tilt pot to check). Remove from heat; leave lid on and rest for 10 minutes (KEY STEP). The residual liquid on the surface of the rice will get absorbed and rice will go from sticky to fluffy. Fluff with fork then serve! (Optional: garnish with extra coriander)
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-meatballs/, Preheat oven to 220C/430F (standard) or 200C/390F (fan / convection). Place a rack on a tray (optional; rack keeps balls slightly rounder). Place Meatball ingredients in a bowl (except oil spray); mix well with your hands. Only use extra breadcrumbs if necessary – sometimes; chicken mince can be quite wet. Scoop up 1 slightly heaped tablespoon and roll into a ball (about 3cm / 1.25″ diameter). (Note 6 for my way) Spray rack well with oil and place the meatballs on the rack. Spray meatballs generously with oil; then bake for 20 – 25 minutes or until a bit browned. They should be beautifully soft – see video! Serve warm with Sauce; garnished with coriander and chillies if desired. Place ingredients in a bowl and mix. Set aside for at least 10 minutes before using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/brown-sugar-apple-muffins/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F. Brush a 12 hole; standard muffin tin with melted butter; or line with paper cases. (Note 3) Place butter and brown sugar in a bowl; whisk to combine. Add milk; then egg and vinegar. Whisk to combine. Scatter flour across batter surface; followed by baking soda; cinnamon and salt. Whisk 10 times until the flour is incorporated – some lumps is fine. Stir through apple -minimum stirs just to disperse. Scoop batter into muffin tin – I use an ice cream scoop – filling it all the way to the top. If using a scooper; leave it the slight ball shape (see video) – don’t smooth the top.  You should get 12 (see Note 3). Sprinkle with sugar (if using – makes surface slightly crispy); place muffins in the oven. Immediately turn down to 180C/350F. Bake for 20 minutes (standard) or 18 minutes (fan / convection) ; or until a skewer comes out clean. Rest in the muffin tin for 5 minutes then transfer to a rack to cool. Once fully cooled; store in an airtight container – it will stay moist for up to 5 days. These also freeze very well.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-coconut-caramel-chicken/, Place sugar and water in a skillet over medium heat. Stir; then when it bubbles and the sugar is melted (it looks like caramel); add the rest of the ingredients except chicken. Stir; then put the chicken in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Adjust the heat so it is simmering energetically. Not rapidly; not a slow simmer (I use medium high heat on a weak stove; medium on a strong stove). After 25 minutes; turn the chicken. After another 25 minutes; the fat should separate from the sauce and turn a pale brown (see video). Turn chicken so the skin side is down. Move it around so the sauce doesn’t catch on the bottom of the skillet and to brown the skin. Once sauce and skin is brown; remove from heat. Place chicken on serving plates; spoon over some sauce (don’t need much; chicken is infused with flavour + sauce is strong). Garnish with shallots and chilli; if using. Serve with rice.
https://www.recipetineats.com/corn-chowder-with-bacon/, Cut the corn off the cob. This is how I do it: Place a small ramekin in a large bowl. Place corn on the ramekin then cut the corn off. See video. Keep naked cobs. Place 1 tsp butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until golden. Use a slotted spoon to remove onto a paper towel lined plate. Leave fat in pot. Lower heat to medium high. Add 2 tbsp butter; once melted; add garlic and onion. Cook for 2 – 3 minutes until onion is translucent. Add flour and mix it in. Cook; stirring; for 1 minute. Add broth; milk; potatoes; thyme and bay leaf. Break naked cobs into 2 or 3 and add into the liquid. Put the lid on and simmer for 25 minutes (adjust heat so it’s simmering energetically but not bubbling like crazy or super gently). Remove lid; remove corn cobs. Add corn and cook for 5 minutes or until cooked to your taste. Stir through cream and 3/4 of the bacon and shallots. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls and garnish with remaining bacon and shallots.
https://www.recipetineats.com/hummus/, Extra smooth optional steps: If you want ultra smooth hummus; do one of the extra Smooth Hummus steps below (I rare bother!). Reserve for garnish: Reserve 10 or so chickpeas for garnish.  Blitz! Place remaining chickpeas; garlic; lemon; tahini and olive oil in a food processor or blender. Blitz until it becomes a paste.  Season – Add salt and pepper – if using canned chickpeas; add salt gradually because the saltiness varies from brand to brand.  Thin sauce – Add reserved liquid from can. Blitz for a couple of minutes until smooth – but note you will have tiny little grains in it; it won't be 100% smooth unless you do one of the extra steps below.  Adjust – Adjust lemon and salt to taste; adjust thickness with more liquid. It should be a soft dropping consistency; like ketchup. Serve the traditional way: dollop a big scoop of hummus on a plate or shallow bowl. Use a spoon to spread it and make swirls on the surface. Top with reserved chickpeas; drizzle generously with more olive oil and sprinkle with paprika. Method 1: Drain chickpease; place in large bowl and fill with water. Grab handfuls and rub between your hands submerged in the water – skins will rub off and float to surface. Skim floating skin off; drain and use per recipe. Method 2: Tip all contents of can INCLUDING liquid into heatproof bowl. Cover loosely with lid or clingwrap; microwave on high for 3 minutes. Drain then use per recipe (hot chickpeas blitz smoother).
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-mushroom-rice/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place mushrooms in a large bowl. Pour over hot melted butter; add garlic; salt and pepper. Toss well. Place all the Rice ingredients in a baking pan – 22 x 33 cm / 9 x 13″. Mine is 30 x 24 cm / 12 x 9.5″ – don’t need to be exact here; but don’t stray too much from pan size. Mix and shake the pan to spread the rice out evenly. Spread the mushrooms over the rice – they will be partially submerged but should pretty much cover the whole surface area (to be the “lid” while the rice cooks). Drizzle over olive oil. Bake for 35 – 40 minutes or until mushroom is golden. Remove from oven and rest for 5 minutes. Finishes: Add extra butter (if using) and scallions. Toss through rice. Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-frozen-pizzas/, Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add remaining ingredients; stir; and adjust heat so it is simmering gently (about medium heat). Cook down for 40 minutes; then puree with a stick (or cool a bit then transfer to blender).  COOL before using (hot sauce = soggy base). (Note 4) Top a flatbread with 2.5 tbsp of Sauce. Sprinkle a tiny amount of cheese over the base; avoiding the very edges (glue for toppings – see video). Sprinkle over onion; capsicum; salami; olives; mushrooms then cheese. Repeat with remaining flatbreads. Stack them using paper in between each pizza. Wrap in groups of 3 or so (whatever you are comfortable handling). Transfer to a large airtight container or ziplock bag and freeze. Baking: Remove oven shelf from oven and clean. Preheat oven to 240C/460F (standard) / 220C / 430F (fan/convection). Place frozen (or unfrozen freshly made) pizza directly on shelf. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden on the edges and the base is crispy. Cut and serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-beef-broccoli-noodles/, Sauce: Place water and cornflour in a bowl; mix. Then add remaining ingredients and mix. Beef: Place in a bowl and add 1 1/2 tbsp Sauce. Mix. Broccoli & Noodles: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add broccoli; cook for 1 minute. Add noodles then after 15 seconds; use a wooden spoon to separate the noodles then immediately drain (don’t have the noodles in the water for more than 1 minute). Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic; quickly stir. Add onion and cook for 1 minute until it’s tinged with brown. Add beef and cook until it changes from red to brown. Add noodles; broccoli and sauce. Toss together for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes or until Sauce thickens and coats the noodles. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and shallots; if using; and serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-italian-chicken-casserole/, Use a small knife to prick 5 or so gashes into the skin of the chicken. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper. Place chicken skin side down in a cold large non stick skillet; then turn stove onto medium high. As it heats up; the fat under the skin will start to melt through the holes in the skin. Cook for 4 – 5 minutes or until the skin is golden and crispy. Turn the chicken and cook the other side for 3 minutes. Remove chicken onto a plate; discard fat (don’t scrape the pan) then return to the stove. Add oil; garlic and onion. Cook for 1 minute; then add capsicum. Cook for 2 minutes then add wine. Bring to a simmer and stir; scraping the pan to get those golden bits mixed in. Once most of the wine is evaporated and it doesn’t smell winey anymore; add the tomato; water and pepper flakes. Stir; bring to a simmer; adjust heat so it’s bubbling energetically but not rapidly (and not slowly). After 5 minutes (or so); stir through olives and capers. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper. Then place chicken into the sauce; being careful not to submerge the skin. Cook for another 5 minutes. Sprinkle over parsley. Serve with crusty bread; or use half the sauce to toss through / pour over pasta and the other half to serve with chicken (see photos in post).
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-sweet-potato-stacks/, Preheat oven to 375F/190C (standard) or 350F/180C (fan/convection). Peel the potatoes; then slice thinly (about 2 mm / 1/10″ thick). Transfer into a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients. Toss well with your hands. Place piles of the slices in the muffin tin. Don’t worry if they are higher than the rim – they shrink about 25%. Top each stack with about 1/2 tsp of the remaining butter mixture in the bowl. Bake for 45 minutes; or until the edge of the top slices are starting to brown and the inside of the stacks are cooked (use skewer or knife to check). Use a fork and knife to remove the stacks from the muffin tin. Optional: Brush tops with residual butter in muffin tin. Serve as soon as possible.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-caramel-pork/, Place sugar and water in a large pot over medium heat. Stir; then when it bubbles and the sugar is melted (it looks like caramel); add the rest of the ingredients. Stir; then adjust the heat so it is simmering fairly energetically. Not rapidly; not a slow simmer (I use medium heat on a weak stove; between medium and low on a strong stove). Simmer for 1.5 hours; uncovered. Stir once or twice while cooking. At around 1.5 hours; when the liquid has reduced down and the pork is tender; (see Note 3 if pork is not yet tender); the fat will separate (see video). Stir and the pork will brown and caramelise in the fat. Once the liquid is all gone and it’s now stuck on the pork pieces; it’s ready. Serve over rice; garnished with fresh chilli and shallots. Simple pickled vegetables are ideal for a side because the fresh acidity pairs well with the rich pork.
https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-parmesan-crusted-cauliflower/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan/convection). Mix Crust ingredients in a small bowl. Break cauliflower into large florets. Cut very large florets into 1.5cm / 3/5″ thick slices; and the medium florets in half. You want a large flat surface area on each piece for the crust to adhere to. Line a baking tray (30 x 40 cm / 12 x 16″) with paper. Drizzle tray with oil. Use a cauliflower to spread the oil all over the paper (see video). Sprinkle Crust mixture all over the tray; as evenly as possible. Don’t touch it once scattered. Place cauliflower down on the Crust mixture; pressing down lightly. Don’t jam them right up against each other (they will steam and go soggy); keep a tiny bit of space between each one. Spray generously with oil. Sprinkle with a bit of black pepper (optional). Bake for 20 minutes until crust is deep golden. Use tongs to turn the cauliflower so the crust side is up. Bake for a further 5 minutes. Serve immediately; sprinkled with finely chopped parsley or other herb; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-chicken-meatballs-spaghetti/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan/convection). Place a rack on a tray; and spray the rack with oil. Place Meatball ingredients in a bowl; mix well. Scoop up a heaped tablespoon; roll into a ball and place on the rack. Repeat with remaining mixture – should make 25 – 30. Tip: spray hands with oil or wet lightly with water. Spray each ball well with oil; then bake for 25 minutes until golden brown. Give ’em a squeeze and you’ll see how soft they are! Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 2 – 3 minutes until translucent. Add tomato and water; stir then turn heat down to medium. Simmer for 5 – 10 minutes; then season to taste with salt and pepper and stir through basil (or use dried herbs). Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water. Drain then return pasta to the same pot. Add Sauce and meatballs; toss. Serve; garnished with fresh basil and parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vanilla-sponge-cake/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan / convection). Put the rack in the middle of the oven. Butter 2 x 20cm / 8″ cake pans (Note 2). Line the base with baking paper. Place Wet ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. Place Dry ingredients in a bowl and use a handheld beater on speed 1 (slowest) to quickly whisk. Add 1/3 of the butter; then put the beater whisk in the butter; and mix using speed 1. Once the butter is incorporated a bit; speed up to 5 and whisk for 10 seconds.  Add another 1/3 of the butter then repeat; then add remaining butter and repeat again. It should look like wet sand (see video / photos in post). Add half the Wet mixture; beat until incorporated. Add remaining Wet mixture; then beat on speed 5 (medium) until almost completely smooth. Divide between cake pans; smooth surface (it levels out in the oven); then bake for 25 minutes. A skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean but moist. Cool on cooling rack for at least 15 minutes then remove cake from pan. Optional: Use a serrated knife (I use a bread knife) to cut the top off each cake to make it completely flat. This makes neat layers when you cut into the cake. Place cream; vanilla and sugar in a bowl. Beat on high with a handheld beater or stand mixer until firm peaks form. If piping little swirls around the edge like in the photos; transfer 1 cup of cream into a piping bag fitted with a large star nozzle. Place a cake on a serving platter. Spread a thin layer of cream over the top. Cover with strawberries; cut side down. Top with 1/3 of the cream. Place 2nd cake on top. Cover top and sides with remaining cream. Pipe cream around the edge. Decorate with remaining strawberries; as desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/rissoles/, Grate the onion into a large bowl using a box grater (see video). Add panko; mix briefly to coat in the onion juices. Grate zucchini and carrot into the bowl. Add remaining Rissoles ingredients. Mix well. Scoop up about 1/4 cup of mixture; form a 1.7cm / 2/3″ thick pattie. Indent the middle slightly (Note 2; see photos in post). Repeat with remaining mixture – you should make 10 – 12. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add half the patties and cook for 4 minutes or until dark golden. Press LIGHTLY with spatula; if you press hard; you’ll press the juices out! Flip and cook the other side for 3 – 4 minutes until golden. Transfer to plate; repeat with remaining rissoles. Serve with tomato ketchup!
https://www.recipetineats.com/roast-pumpkin-spinach-and-feta-salad/, Preheat oven to 220C/430F (standard) or 200C/390F (fan/convection). Toss pumpkin with olive oil; salt and pepper. Spread on baking tray; bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven; flip; then bake for a further 7 – 10 minutes until golden but not mushy. (Note 3) Loosen pumpkin with egg flip (it can adhere as it cools); then if serving salad at room temperature; leave to cool. Shake Dressing in a jar. Taste and adjust to taste. I like it a bit sharp because it balances out the flavours in this salad. Toast pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat until light golden and it smells nutty. Remove pine nuts from skillet as soon as it’s ready. Place Spinach in a bowl. Drizzle with a bit of dressing then toss. Add pumpkin; just a bit of feta and pine nuts; then GENTLY BRIEFLY toss just to disperse the feta. (If you toss vigorously; the feta can make it look messy). Transfer to serving plate. Sprinkle over remaining feta and pine nuts. Just before serving; drizzle with remaining dressing (dressing doesn’t stay on baby spinach well; so worth drizzling at end). Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-granola-muesli/, Preheat oven to 150C/300F. Combine Dry ingredients; excluding dried fruit. Combine Wet ingredients. Combine Wet and Dry ingredients. Do a taste test. Adjust to taste – more sweet; more fat etc. Spread on baking tray and bake until golden; approximately 35 – 40 minutes; tossing twice. Stir through dried fruit. Cool. Store in an airtight container. Preheat oven to 140C/280F. Line a large baking tray with baking paper. Combine Wet excluding egg whites. Combine Dry including dried fruit. Whisk egg whites with fork until foamy. Mix Wet and Dry in a large bowl; then mix through egg whites. Spread granola on the tray; making a hole in the centre; like a doughnut (see photo in post). Bake for 45 minutes – DO NOT STIR – until golden. Check at 35 minutes.  Then turn the oven off; leave the granola in the oven; and open the oven door open a bit. Leave the granola to cool. The colour will deepen and it will firm up. Once cool; break into clusters. Store in an airtight container.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-with-mushroom-gravy/, Place a plastic bag or cling wrap over the chicken and pound to even thickness 2cm / 4/5″ thick. Sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil and melt 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add chicken and cook for 3 minutes or until golden; then turn and cook the other side for 3 minutes. Transfer to plate; cover loosely with foil. Add 1 tbsp butter to the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes or until pretty golden. Add remaining 1 tbsp butter and garlic. Cook for 1 minute until mushrooms are golden. Turn heat DOWN to medium. Add flour and mix for 1 minute. Add about 1/4 of the beef broth; mixing as you go. Once incorporated; add remaining broth gradually; mixing constantly. This is key to avoid lumps in gravy. Use a whisk if needed (works fine even with mushrooms in there) (Note 3 for beginner option). Cook gravy for about 2 minutes or until it thickens to your taste – remember it will thicken more as it cools when serving. Adjust salt and pepper. If you want; return chicken to the pan and turn to coat in gravy. Place chicken on serving plates; top with gravy. Best served with mashed potato or similar to optimise the mushroom gravy experience!
https://www.recipetineats.com/spinach-ricotta-cannelloni/, Sauté – Heat oil in a small pot over medium high heat. Add garlic; onion; bay leaf; thyme and oregano. Cook for 3 – 4 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Reduce wine – Add wine; increase heat to high and let it simmer rapidly until mostly evaporated (about 2 minutes). Simmer – Add tomatoes; stock; sugar; salt and pepper. Stir then simmer on medium low for 20 minutes. Blitz – Remove bay leaf then blitz with a stick blender until smooth. Simmer for 1 more minute then remove from the stove Basil –  Stir in basil then cover to keep warm until required. Squeeze spinach – Place spinach in a colander and press out most of the liquid (don't need to thoroughly squeeze dry). Mix filling – Place Spinach in bowl with remaining Filling ingredients. Mix; taste; adjust salt and pepper to taste (different cheeses have different saltiness). Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Pan – Choose a baking pan which will comfortably fit about 20 cannelloni – mine is 21 x 26 cm / 8.5 x 10.5". Smear – Spread 1 cup of Sauce on the base (stops cannelloni from sliding around). Fill tubes – Transfer Filling to a piping bag with a large nozzle (that fits in the tubes); or use a strong ziplock bag. Or do this step using a knife (it's a bit tedious though!). Pipe the filling into the tubes.  Assemble – Place cannelloni in baking dish. Pour over remaining Sauce; covering all the tubes.  Bake covered (but naked) – Cover with foil; then bake for 30 minutes. Cheese it! Remove foil; scatter over parmesan then mozzarella. Return to oven for 15 minutes until cheese is melted. Serve; garnished with extra parmesan and basil if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-roasted-parmesan-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 200C/400F (180C fan-forced). Mix Parmesan Mixture in a bowl. Drizzle oil in 22 x 33cm / 9 x 13″ glass baking dish (Note 2). Tilt pan to spread all over the base. Use a spoon to scatter the Parmesan Mixture over the base. Spread as evenly as you can. Once sprinkled; do not touch – don’t try to spread it. Place potatoes cut side down; pressing firmly. Optional: drizzle top of potatoes with a touch of oil or spray with oil; then sprinkle with salt. Bake potatoes for 35 – 40 minutes or until they are soft and the parmesan crust is deep golden (you can check through the glass!) REST for 5 minutes. Then use an egg flip to cut between every 4 or so potatoes (i.e. cutting through the parmesan crust which bonds between each potato – see video); then scoop up 4 or so potatoes and flip them upside down so the cheese side is up on a serving platter.  Serve with Dipping Sauce; if using; and sprinkle over extra green onions if desired. Serve as a side dish or as nibbles!
https://www.recipetineats.com/oven-baked-rice-and-vegetables/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) / 180C/350F (fan / convection). Mix Spice Mix in a small bowl. Place Rice ingredients in a baking dish (including the carrots); about 23 x 30 cm /  9 x 13″. Add 1 1/2 tsp Spice Mix. Stir; cover with foil; bake for 20 minutes. Meanwhile; place Roasting Vegetable ingredients in a large bowl; drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil. Sprinkle over remaining Spice Mix. Mix well – hands are best for this. Remove rice from oven. Turn oven UP to 220C/430F (standard) / 200C/390F (fan / convection). Take off foil. Spread the Roasting Vegetables on top of the rice. Make sure there’s a bit of each type of vegetable on the surface. Push corn mostly under. Drizzle with more oil (optional); sprinkle with more pepper. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven; rest for 5 – 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley if desired. Push vegetables aside; fluff rice and toss it through the vegetables a bit (rice gets more flavour). Serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/best-easy-peanut-butter-cookies/, Place ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. It will be soft; too soft for scooping.  Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Meanwhile; preheat oven to 180C / 350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan / convection). Line 2 trays with parchment paper. Place 1 tbsp scoops of the dough onto the trays (I use a cookie scoop) 5cm/2″ apart. Dip a large fork in a bowl of hot tap water (stops fork sticking to dough). Press down on the dough; then press 90 degrees the other way (watch video) so the cookie is 1 cm / 2/5″ thick. Re-dip fork in water as required. Put both trays in the oven and bake for 10 minutes; swapping the trays halfway through; or until light golden on the surface and golden on the edges. (Or longer if you want crisper cookies) Leave to cool on the tray. Store in an airtight container for up to 4 – 5 days.
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-zucchini-soup/, Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add garlic and onions; and cook for 3 – 4 minutes until they are light golden brown. Add zucchinis; broth and water. Bring to a boil; then cover and reduce heat to medium. Optional: Scoop brown foam (scum) off surface every now and then. Cook for 15 – 20 minutes or until zucchini is very soft. Use a stick blender to whizz until smooth. (Note 1 for blender) Stir through cream and milk. Add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls; swirl over a touch of cream if desired; a pinch of shredded parmesan; and more pepper. Serve hot or at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sausage-pasta/, Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Cook pasta per packet directions MINUS 1 -2 minutes. Just before you drain; RESERVE 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain pasta. Use a sharp knife to cut sausages into chunks about 1.5cm/3/5″. It will get a bit smeary and the chunks will be weird shapes – don’t worry; it self fixes while cooking! Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add sausages and cook until quite browned on the outside; doesn’t have to be cooked through inside. Add onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent and sausages are very browned. Add tomato; chilli flakes; pinch of salt and pepper. Mix and turn heat down to medium. Lets it bubble away energetically for 8 minutes or until it is quite thickened; stirring every now and then. Add baby spinach (if using); pasta; and about 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. Toss quickly; no longer than 1 minute (otherwise the pasta may start to break). Remove from stove; and serve immediately; garnished with plenty of basil and parmesan. Enjoy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/osso-buco/, Sprinkle both sides of the veal very generously with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add beef and sear on both sides so it has a nice brown crust. Remove onto a plate; turn heat down to medium low. If the pot is looking dry; add a splash of oil. Add garlic and onion; cook for 1 minute; then add carrot and celery. Cook on low heat for 8 minutes or until it is softened and sweet. OPTIONAL: Meanwhile; tie kitchen string around each piece of veal – holds it together for nice presentation (it falls apart once slow cooked). Add tomato; wine; broth; bouillon cube (crumbled); tomato paste; thyme; and bay leaves. Mix; then return veal into pot; place lid on. Adjust heat so the liquid is simmering gently – about medium low. Cook until tender enough to be pried apart with forks – check at 1.5 hours then every 15 minutes after that. Use slotted spoon to remove veal into bowl; cover to keep warm. Simmer liquid on medium for 5 – 15 minutes or until thickened to taste. Adjust salt & pepper at the end. Traditionally served with Saffron Risotto (Risotto Milanese; recipe in notes); but is also terrific with mashed potato; creamy polenta or even pasta. Place a piece of Osso Buco on the serving plate; spoon over sauce; then top with Gremolata. Place the parsley leaves on a cutting board. Top with garlic and lemon zest. Finely chop the parsley. Transfer to serving bowl and set aside for at least 20 minutes before use.
https://www.recipetineats.com/salted-caramel-tart/, Preheat oven to 180*C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Grease and line the base only of a 23cm / 9" tart tin with a loose base. (Or a springform pan of a similar size) Blitz biscuits – Roughly break up biscuits and place in a food processor; then whizz until fine crumbs form. Or do this step with a ziplock bag and rolling pin. Press – Pour crumbs into a bowl; add melted butter; mix until it looks like wet sand and no dry crumbs remain. Pour into tin; then press firmly into base and sides – use something flat like a cup to assist (refer to video). Bake & cool – Transfer to tray (safe handling); place in oven and bake for 10 minutes; then remove and cool slightly (5 minutes in fridge). Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar and whisk to combine – butter may not incorporate fully.  Whisk – Once it starts bubbling and the sugar is completely melted; pour in the condensed milk; whisking as you go. Whisk constantly until you see steam coming off the caramel (~ 4 minutes); then remove from heat. Pour into base – Add salt (adjust to taste); then pour the caramel into the tart base. Bake for 15 minutes or until the edges of the caramel surface is golden and the surface has a “skin” on it; but the caramel is still soft and the centre jiggles slightly (see video for demo.) Cool on counter while you make the chocolate. Melt chocolate – Place cream and chocolate in a heat proof bowl. Microwave in 2 x 30 second bursts; stirring in between; until smooth. Cool then pour – Set aside for 10 minutes to thicken slightly; then pour over the base. Smooth top or make swirls like I did (just wait until the chocolate thickens slightly). Sprinkle with sea salt flakes. Refrigerate for 1 ½ hours to allow chocolate to set. Then remove and bring to room temperature before slicing to serve. Handle carefully when sliding the tart off the base – or just leave it on to be safe and just remove the sides.

https://www.recipetineats.com/sexy-lentil-salad/, Place Lentil ingredients in a large saucepan over high heat. Bring to simmer then turn down to medium low. Cook for 20 minutes for firm (I like this) or 25 minutes for soft. DO NOT overcook and make it mushy! Drain in a colander; pick out celery etc. Rinse VERY quickly just to remove any grit coating the lentils (don’t want to rinse away flavour!). Set aside. Place Dressing ingredients in a jar; shake well. Place lentils; tomato; cucumber; onion; coriander; parsley and some of the feta in a large bowl. Pour over most of the Dressing; then toss. Place rocket lettuce on a serving platter. Pile salad on top. Drizzle over remaining Dressing and crumble over feta. Serve! (I like serving with pita bread to stuff it in)
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooked-shredded-beef-ragu-pasta/, Pat beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper Sear Beef: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil over high heat in a heavy based pot. Add beef and sear each piece aggressively on all sides until very browned (3 – 5 minutes in total); then remove onto a plate. Turn stove down to medium low and add remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil. Soffrito: Add garlic and onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add the carrots and celery and sauté slowly for 5 minutes. Add remaining Ragu ingredients and return the beef to the pot (including pooled juices). Turn the stove up and bring it to a simmer; then turn it down to low so it’s bubbling very very gently. (Note 7) Slow cook: Cover the pot and let it cook for 2 hours or until beef is tender enough to shred. (Note 5 for slow cooker and pressure cooker).  Shred: Remove beef then coarsely shred with 2 forks. Return beef to the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes until sauce is reduced and thickened – beef will soften slightly more during this step. Final season: Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning to your taste with salt and pepper. ALSO; add 1/2 tsp sugar if sauce is a bit sour for your taste (Note 6). Place the lid on and set aside until ready to serve (it’s even better the next day and freezes well for months!). Bring a very large pot of water with 1 tbsp of salt to the boil. Add pasta and cook for 1 minute less than the recommended cooking time as per the packet instructions. Meanwhile; place 5 cups of the Ragu in a very large fry pan; dutch oven or use 2 normal size fry pans. Heat over high heat while the pasta is cooking. When the pasta is ready; transfer it directly from the pot into the fry pan using tongs. Add 3/4 cup of pasta water into the fry pan. Gently toss the pasta (I use 2 wooden spoons) for 1 to 2 minutes; until the sauce water evaporates and leaves you with a thick Ragu sauce that coats the pasta. Yell for your family to sit down at the dinner table because you need to serve it immediately! Serve with plenty of freshly grated parmesan; or even better; with parmigiano reggiano.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chorizo-black-bean-and-corn-salsa/, Chop chorizo into small pieces. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.

Turn stove down to medium low. If the pot is looking dry; add more oil. Add onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add finely chopped carrots and celery; cook for 6 minutes or until softened and sweet (taste test!). Add carrot chunks and cook for 2 minutes. Add flour and stir through. Add ale; beef stock; and stir to dissolve the flour. Add thyme; bay leaves; porcini; reserved porcini soaking liquid (don’t tip in gritty bits settled at bottom) and cooked beef. Turn heat up slightly; mix; bring to simmer; then cover. Adjust heat so it is simmering gently; not energetically. Cook for 1 hr 45 minutes or until beef is tender. (See video) Meanwhile; cook bacon in a skillet over high heat until golden. Remove and reserve bacon drippings in pan. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until golden all over. Return bacon into skillet; toss to coat mushrooms; then stir through stew. Simmer stew; uncovered; for 15 minutes until mushrooms are tender. Then remove from stove and cool. Preheat oven to 200C/390F. Pour stew into a pie dish; even out surface. Pictured pie dish is 24 x 20 x 4.5 cm / 10 x 8 x 1.8″ (1.5L / 1.5 Qt) – see Notes for more conversions. Top with puff pastry (if too big; just fold the ends in); brush with egg yolk.

Microwave 30 – 40 seconds on high; until butter melts when stirred. If time permits; cool (place in fridge to speed up). (Note 1) Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan/convection) or BBQ on medium high with hood down. Tear 4 x 45cm/18″ pieces of heavy duty foil (Note 2). Divide potatoes among foil sheets. Top with cheese; then prawns and asparagus; then drizzle over cream sauce. Sprinkle with salt; pepper and parsley. Bring the long ends of the foil together over the prawns; then fold down to seal; then fold in the sides (watch video; it’s easy!) Place on a baking tray or BBQ and cook for 10 minutes (small prawns) – 12 minutes (medium prawns). (Note 4) Serve immediately – do not leave them sitting around inside the unopened packet; the prawns and asparagus will overcook and leech water; making the sauce watery.
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-pumpkin-gnocchi/, Line a colander with 4 sheets of paper towel. Spread the fresh mashed pumpkin or canned puree onto the paper towel (see photo in post) then leave for 5 minutes. Measure out 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree (scale up if you scaled recipe; Note 6). Place pumpkin and remaining Gnocchi ingredients in a bowl. Use a wooden spoon to mix well – it should be a soft dough. (Note 4) Dust a work surface with flour; tip dough out; sprinkle with flour then pat into log shape. Cut into 6 pieces. Roll into 1.7cm / 2/3″ ropes; then cut into squares (Note 5). Optional: Use a fork to press down lightly on the cut side of the gnocchi. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Scrape gnocchi onto parchment paper; then tip into water. Cook for 1 minute or until all the gnocchi rises to the surface (means it is cooked); then drain. Meanwhile; melt about 1 teaspoon of the butter plus oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add gnocchi and cook; shaking the pan; until the gnocchi is just starting to turn brown (about 1 1/2 minutes). Add remaining butter; once it melts; add sage leaves. Stir and cook for 2 1/2 minutes or until gnocchi is golden; sage is crisp and butter is slightly browned. Add salt if you used unsalted butter. Serve immediately; garnished with parmesan and pepper.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-stir-fry-with-rice-noodles/, Mix chicken; cornstarch and oil in a bowl. Mix Sauce ingredients in a bowl. OR use 3 tbsp Homemade Stir Fry Sauce + 6 tbsp water.

https://www.recipetineats.com/pancake-recipe/, Place flour; baking powder; sugar and salt in a bowl; whisk to combine. Add egg; milk and vanilla. Whisk until lump free – no longer than 30 seconds. Heat a non stick skillet – use medium heat if you have a strong stove; medium high if you have a weak one. Add a tiny bit of butter (about 1/2 tsp) and swirl to melt. Use paper towel to mostly wipe the butter off (this is the trick to avoid a dodgy 1st pancake). Pour 1/4 cup batter into the middle of the fry pan (I use a slightly heaped ice cream scoop with lever; standard is 1/4 cup). Swirl pan lightly to spread or use the ice cream scoop edge to spread into 11cm / 4.5″ circle (ruler is a must) (joking!). When bubbles rise to the surface (see video); flip and cook the other side until golden. Remove and keep warm in a low oven. Use more butter every 2 to 3 pancakes – depends how good your non stick coating is. Serve with toppings of choice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-chicken/, Place Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag or bowl and mix to combine. Add chicken and mix to coat. Marinade for 3 – 24 hours. Optional: Cut chicken into bite size or large pieces and thread onto skewers. Use 1 skewer for small pieces; 2 for large; like pictured in post. Heat half the oil in a heavy based skillet over medium high heat; or BBQ on medium (if using grill side; brush oil on bars). Remove chicken from marinade (RESERVE for basting) and place in the skillet – cook in 2 batches; don’t crowd the pan. Cook for 4 minutes then turn. Use the Marinade to baste the cooked side of the chicken. After 3 minutes; turn the chicken over so the basted side is now cooking again – cook for 1 minute. Baste the chicken; then turn again and cook for 45 sec – 1 min. Transfer chicken to a plate; cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 minutes. Serve; garnished with green onions / scallions if using!
https://www.recipetineats.com/no-knead-cinnamon-rolls/, Place the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a medium bowl; then pour in water. Leave for 5 minutes until it froths. Place 600g/20oz flour; remaining sugar and salt in a bowl. Mix to combine. Make a well in the centre. Add milk; butter; eggs and pour in the yeast liquid; including all froth. Mix until combined with wooden spoon – it will be like a sticky muffin batter; not kneadable. Rise # 1: Cover with cling wrap and place in a warm place (25C/77F+) to rise for around 1 1/4 – 1 1/2 hrs or until almost tripled in volume. (Note 4) Dough surface should be bubbly (see video or photos in post). Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang. Mix cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Uncover dough; mix with spoon to deflate. Sprinkle half Extra Flour on work surface; pour dough on; sprinkle over remaining Extra Flour. Use hands to incorporate the flour into the dough – it may not absorb it all (or need more); the dough will stop absorbing flour when it’s no longer sticky; should be soft; pliable. If work surface is now flour free; sprinkle with more flour. Shape dough into log; then roll out into 28 x 48 cm / 11 x 19″ rectangle. Pour over butter; then brush all over; then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Roll up firmly; then shape into an even log. Cut into 12 pieces (4cm / 1.6″); then place on tray (3 x 4). Cover with tea towel then place in warm place for 40 minutes or until almost doubled. Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan / convection). Place shelf in the middle of the oven. Bake for 20 minutes; rotating the tray at 16 minutes. Buns are ready when the middle rolls are golden and the outer ones are deep golden on the edges. Tap the middle ones – they should sound hollow. Optional: Brush with 1 tbsp / 15g melted butter to remove any residual flour spots. Use paper overhang to lift rolls onto cooling rack (key step – Note 5). Cool for 1 hour (will still be warm). Use a spoon to frost with glaze. Best served warm! Place butter; cream cheese and vanilla in a bowl. Beat until smooth (10 – 15 seconds). Add icing sugar; beat to incorporate. Add enough milk to make it a consistency that can be spooned over the buns and it drips slightly (see video).
https://www.recipetineats.com/tuna-pasta-bake/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Cook pasta per packet directions; minus 1 minute. Drain; rinse under tap water to stop it sticking together; set aside. Meanwhile; make the sauce. Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 3 minutes until golden. Add tomato; water; herbs; salt and pepper and tomato paste if using. Stir; bring to simmer; lower heat to medium and simmer energetically for 5 minutes (stir every now and then) until it thickens. Adjust salt to taste. Also add a touch of sugar if it tastes a bit sour (depends on quality of tomato). Turn the stove off; add pasta; stir in. Add tuna and GENTLY stir it in – don’t break up the tuna so it disintegrates into mush. Leave some chunks on the surface (nice when it is golden). Drizzle with oil; top with cheese then bake for 20 minutes until golden and you get those nice crusty bits you see in the photos. Stand for 3 minutes then serve!
https://www.recipetineats.com/carne-asada/, Place the Marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag and mix. Add beef and massage through the bag to coat evenly. Seal then marinate for 1- 8 hours (12 hours max; otherwise meat gets over marinated and can be mushy). Take the skirt steak out of the fridge 20 – 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature. Brush BBQ with oil and heat on high until smoking (or use a large skillet over high heat and turn the fan on!). Cook skirt steak for 3 minutes each side for rare; 4 minutes for medium rare. For flank; cook for 4 minutes each side for rare and 5 minutes for medium rare. Don’t cook beyond medium – chewy beef! Remove onto a plate and cover loosely with foil. Rest for 5 minutes then slice thinly against the grain (Note 2). Serve with tacos; in burritos or on rice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-chip-cookies/, Preheat oven to 180C / 350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan / convection). Place oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Line 2 trays with baking / parchment paper. Whisk the flour; salt and baking soda in a bowl. Place the butter in a large heatproof bowl. Microwave until the butter is almost fully melted (25 sec for room temp butter; 40 sec for fridge cold butter on high). Whisk to finish melting the butter. (Note 2) Add brown and white sugar; whisk energetically for 15 seconds. Add egg; yolk and vanilla; whisk well for 15 seconds. Add flour mixture and mix until flour is almost fully incorporated. Add 1 cup chocolate chips; stir to disperse and flour is fully incorporated. Batter will be quite loose. Stand for 5 minutes for batter to firm up a bit so it is scoop-able into mounds. (Note 3) LARGE COOKIES: Scoop up a level ice cream scoop / 3 tbsp / 1/4 cup (Note 4) and place on baking trays 5cm / 2″ apart – 13 balls. Top with remaining choc chips (these remain on surface once baked = prettier). SMALL COOKIES (26 – 30): Scoop up 1.5 tbsp (heaped tbsp measure) OR 1/2 an ice cream scoop (this works well). Place on baking trays 4cm / 1.75″ apart; top with choc chops. Bake 1 tray at a time. LARGE COOKIES: Bake for 8 minutes; then rotate the tray and bake for 3 minutes (11 minutes in total). SMALL COOKIES: Bake 6 minutes; turn then bake 3 minutes (9 min total). The cookies should be just golden on the edges and pale golden on top. They will be slightly puffed up. Cool on the tray – they finish cooking. They will lose the puffiness while resting. Dig in and get your cookie fix!

https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-broccoli-cheese-balls/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F (all oven types). Line tray with baking / parchment paper. (Note 2) Place all ingredients (except oil spray) in a bowl. Mix well to combine; mashing up the broccoli as you go (like when you are cooking mince). Scoop up a heaped tablespoon; then press in firmly. Flick out into your hand then form into a ball. Place on tray. Repeat with remaining mixture – should make 15 – 18 balls. Spray with oil then bake for 25 minutes; or until the surface is slightly crisp and golden. Serve with Lemon Yoghurt Sauce – it also goes great with ketchup! Sauce: Mix ingredients together then set aside for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavours to meld.
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-rendang/, Place Spice Paste ingredients in a small food processor and whizz until fine. NOTE: If using dried chilli and you know your food processor is not that powerful; chop the chilli first. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add half the beef and brown; then remove onto plate. Repeat with remaining beef. Lower heat to medium low. Add Spice Paste and cook for 2 – 3 minutes until the wetness has reduced and the spice paste darkens (don’t breathe in too much; the chilli will make you cough!). Add remaining Curry ingredients and beef. Stir to combine. Bring to simmer; then immediately turn down the heat to low or medium low so the sauce is bubbling very gently. Put the lid on the pot and leave it to simmer for 1 hr 15 minutes. Remove lid and check the beef to see how tender it is. You don’t want it to be “fall apart at a touch” at this stage; but it should be quite tender. If it is fall apart already; remove the beef from the pot before proceeding. Turn up heat to medium and reduce sauce for 30 – 40 minutes; stirring every now and then at first; then frequently towards the end until the beef browns and the sauce reduces to a paste that coats the beef. (Note 9)  The beef should now be very tender; fall apart at a touch. If not; add a splash of water and keep cooking. Remove from heat and serve with plain or Restaurant Style Coconut Rice.
https://www.recipetineats.com/tomato-bacon-pasta/, Have the ingredients lined up and ready to start cooking at the same time. Bring a large pot of water to the bowl. Add a pinch of salt. Cook pasta according to packet but MINUS 2 minutes. Meanwhile; heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add bacon and cook for 1 minute; then add garlic and onion and cook for 3 minutes or until onion is translucent and bacon is golden. Drain excess fat if desired. Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water; then pour about 1/2 cup into the skillet. Bring to simmer and stir; scraping the skillet to dissolve in all the golden bits stuck on the pan into the liquid. Add tomato; bring to simmer and cook for 2 minutes; then turn down to medium high. Drain pasta; or if you timed it right; use tongs to transfer it straight from the pot into the skillet. Toss gently using two wooden spoons for 2 minutes; or until the sauce is no longer sitting in the skillet; it’s all on the pasta (see video). If it gets too thick; just add an extra splash of the pasta cooking water. Season with salt and pepper (remember bacon is salty!). Serve immediately; garnished with parmesan; parsley and final drizzle of olive oil if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-parmesan-cabbage-salad-with-grilled-chicken/, If the chicken is much thicker than 2cm / 4/5″; pound lightly or cut in half horizontally. Place the Grilled Chicken ingredients in a ziplock bag and set aside for 30 minutes to overnight. Use the oil to brush the grill; or heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook the chicken for 4 minutes on each side; then remove onto a plate. Cover loosely with foil; rest for 5 minutes; then slice thinly. Cook the peas in boiling water (or steam); drain then rinse under cold tap water to cool down. Place cabbage; peas; mint and onion in a bowl. Add parmesan; lemon juice; olive oil; and pepper. Toss well. Adjust salt to taste; add more parmesan if desired. Transfer to serving plates; top with chicken. Garnish with more parmesan and black pepper; then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lasagna/, Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic; onion; celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do; turn heat down). Add beef; turn heat up and cook the beef; breaking it up as you go. Once the beef has all turned brown; add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar. Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours; stirring every now and then; then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes. The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste; and add sugar if required (Note 3) Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster). In a large saucepan; melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute. Pour about 1 cup of the milk in; mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free; add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free. Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon. Remove from heat; add cheese; nutmeg; salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick; add a splash of water or milk. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish. Smear a bit of Ragu on the base; then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit. Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets); then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu; then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time. Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets; then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce. Sprinkle with Mozzarella; then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling. Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving; garnished with basil or parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/honey-garlic-salmon-5-ingredients-15-minutes/, Take salmon out of the fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Pat salmon skin dry with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Whisk together the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Drizzle oil in a non stick fry pan and heat over medium high heat (or just under; if your stove runs hot). Place salmon in the pan; and cook the first side for 3 – 4 minutes until golden. Turn; then cook the other side for 2 – 3 minutes or until golden. Pour Sauce over salmon. Cook for 1 minute or until it starts to thicken slightly. Check the side of the salmon to tell how cooked through the middle is – I like mine medium rare inside. (Note 1). If Sauce thickens too much before your salmon is cooked to your taste; just add water 1 tbsp at a time. Remove onto serving plates. Serve salmon drizzled with Sauce; sprinkled with sesame seeds and chives/shallots; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-coconut-chicken/, Mix marinade in a large bowl. Add chicken and mix. Cover with cling wrap and marinate in the fridge for 24 – 48 hours (can’t skip marinating for this recipe). Brush BBQ with oil; or heat 1 tbsp in a skillet (I used a skillet). Use Medium heat – or Medium Low if your stove/BBQ runs hot (otherwise marinade may burn).  Remove chicken from marinade; shaking off excess. Cook the first side for around 5 minutes or until caramelised and golden. Turn then cook the other side for 4 minutes until caramelised. BAKING: See Note 4. Transfer chicken to serving plate; cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 minutes. Garnish with coriander / chilli if desired; and serve with lime wedges and Sauce. Place ingredients in a bowl and mix a bit. Microwave for 30 seconds; then mix until smooth. Bring to room temperature or serve warm (it thickens a bit when cooled).
https://www.recipetineats.com/best-easy-chocolate-cupcakes/, Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Put oven rack in the middle of the oven. Place 12 cupcake liners in a cupcake tin. Sift Dry ingredients into a bowl. Whisk briefly. Place butter and chocolate in a separate; large heatproof bowl. Microwave for 45 seconds; mix; then microwave for another 30 seconds. Mix until chocolate is melted and smooth (keep microwaving in 20 sec bursts if chocolate not melted). Add cocoa powder and mix. Add milk and oil; then eggs; vanilla and vinegar. Whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture and whisk until lump free. Divide mixture between cupcake liners. I use a ice cream scoop for this. They should be just over 3/4 full. Bake for 18 – 20 minutes; or until skewer inserted into the cupcake in the middle of the tray comes out clean. Remove from oven and immediately transfer to cooling rack (spoon or knife helps). Once cool; spread with frosting and decorate with sprinkles if desired. Alternatively; use Chocolate Buttercream Frosting! Melt butter then mix in cocoa powder until smooth. Add icing sugar and milk. Mix until smooth. Use milk to adjust consistency if required – it should be a soft spreadable consistency (like peanut butter).
https://www.recipetineats.com/oven-baked-italian-meatballs/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place onion; garlic and olive oil in a (approx) 30 x 25 cm / 12 x 10″ pan (Note 4). Mix; spread out; then bake for 8 minutes. (Start the meatballs) Remove from oven; add remaining Sauce ingredients. Mix. Place rack on top of pan. Turn oven up to 200C/390F. Place the bread and onion in a large bowl. Mix to combine so the onion juice soaks the bread; set aside for 3 minutes. Bread should disintegrate into mush – if not; add a splash of milk or water to help it along. Add all the remaining Meatball ingredients except oil spray. Use you hands to mix well. Measure out very generously heaped tablespoons and roll into firm balls. It should make around 20 – don’t make them too small; they will cook too quickly. Place meatballs on the rack; ensuring they are positioned over the pan so the juices will drip into the Sauce. Spray generously with oil. Bake for 20 minutes. Optional: flick to grill/broil on high for 2 minutes at the end; to get better browning. Transfer meatballs from rack into the Sauce. Stir to coat meatballs in Sauce. Serve with spaghetti or other pasta of choice; garnished with fresh parsley and parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-balsamic-chicken/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Line a baking dish with foil and baking / parchment paper. Mix together Sauce in a bowl. Place chicken in baking dish; skin side down for thighs and wings. Make sure the pan is big enough so the chicken is squished up next to each other (sauce may not reduce enough); but not so large that there is more than 4″/10 cm between every piece of chicken (sauce may reduce too much). Pour over Sauce. Bake 30 minutes. Turn chicken over; spoon over sauce. Bake 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. The Sauce should have thickened. Stand for 5 minutes; then spoon Sauce over chicken and serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cowboy-rice-salad/, Place Dressing ingredients in a jar; shake. Taste test; adjust to your taste. Place Salad ingredients and rice in a bowl. Drizzle with dressing. Toss; then serve. Fantastic served straight away and even the next day!
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-creamy-cheesy-potato-bake/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all types). Peel and cut the potatoes into 1 3/4 cm / 2/3″ cubes. Place in a large bowl. Add all remaining ingredients except mozzarella. Mix. Pour into a 3 litre / quart baking dish (mine is 22cm / 9″ square x 6 cm / 2.3″ high). Cover with foil. Bake 60 minutes; or until potatoes are tender. Remove foil; sprinkle over mozzarella cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until cheese is golden. Rest for 5 – 10 minutes before serving; garnished with extra theme leaves if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cured-salmon-gravlax/, Crush peppercorns with the side of a knife (or roughly grind using mortar and pestle). Combine peppercorns with salt; sugar and dill. Place 2 large pieces of cling wrap on a work surface; slightly overlapping. Spread half the salt mixture in the shape of the salmon. Place salmon on salt; skin side down. Top with remaining salt mixture. Wrap with cling wrap. Place in a large dish. Top with something flat (like small cutting board) then 3  x 400g / 14oz cans (“Weights”). Refrigerate for 12 hours. There will be liquid in the dish. Turn salmon over (will be gloopy/wet)); then replace Weights and return to fridge. After another 12 hours; turn salmon over again; replace Weights. After another 12 hours; remove salmon from fridge. 36 hours total for Medium Cure – Perfect Gravlax to my taste (See Note 2 for description and more curing times). Unwrap salmon; scrape off salt then rinse. Pat dry. If time permits; return to the fridge for 3 – 12 hours uncovered (dries surface better; lets salt “settle” and permeate through flesh more evenly). Sprinkle over the 1/4 cup extra dill – for garnish and flavour. Slice thinly on an angle; do not cut through skin (i.e. don’t eat skin). Serve with toasted bread; Mustard Sauce; extra dill and lemon wedges. Mix ingredients; making sure to season with salt and pepper. It should taste like a creamy mustard – a touch of tartness; but mostly to add moisture to the dish. You can add lemon juice and/or zest if you wish – I like to serve with wedges so people can adjust to their taste.
https://www.recipetineats.com/soft-no-knead-dinner-rolls/, Place the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a medium bowl; then pour in water. Leave for 5 minutes until it froths. Place flour; remaining sugar and salt in a bowl. Mix to combine. Make a well in the centre. Add milk; butter; eggs and pour in the yeast liquid; including all froth. Mix until combined with wooden spoon – it will be like a thick muffin batter. Not pourable; but thick and sticky. Leave dough in the bowl; cover with a wet (clean) tea towel and place in a warm place (25C/77F+) to rise for around 1 1/2 – 2 hours or until almost tripled in volume. See Note 4 for how I do this (you will laugh – but it works every time!). Dough surface should be bubbly (see video or photos in post). Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang. Remove tea towel and punch dough to deflate; then mix briefly in the bowl to get rid of the bubbles in the dough. Dust work surface with flour; scrape dough on work surface. Dust top of dough then shape into a log. Cut log into 4 pieces; then cut each piece into 3 pieces (12 in total).  Take one piece and press down with palm; then use your fingers to gather into a ball; flip (so smooth side is up) then roll the dough briefly to form a ball. This stretches the dough on one side and that’s how I get a nice smooth surface on my roll. (For this step; use as much flour as needed to handle dough and avoid piercing inside into the wet dough) Place the ball with the smooth side up on the tray. Repeat with remaining dough. Line them up 3 x 4. Spray surface of rolls (or cling wrap) with oil (any); then place cling wrap over the tray. Return tray to warm place and leave for 30 – 45 min; until the dough has risen by about 75% (less than double in size). Partway through Rise #2; preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan/convection). Bake for 15 – 18 minutes; or until the surface is a golden brown and the roll in the centre sounds hollow when tapped. The surface colour is the best test for this recipe. Remove rolls from oven. Brush with melted butter. Use overhang to lift rolls onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool to warm before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/custard-creme-anglaise/, Using a small knife; cut a slit down the length of the vanilla bean then scrape out seeds (see video). Place cream; milk and vanilla seeds + vanilla bean into a small saucepan over medium heat. When it just comes to simmer; remove and cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile; place yolks and sugar in a bowl. Whisk for 2 minutes until it becomes a bit pale. Remove vanilla pod from milk and discard. While whisking; SLOWLY pour milk into the eggs. Then pour it back into the saucepan. Return to low heat (can use medium low if on electric). Whisk regularly for first 3 minutes; then pretty much constantly for the next 5 minutes; or until the custard coats the back of a spoon. You should be able to draw a path (see video). Remove from heat. Optional: strain to make extra silky smooth. Keeps for 3 days in the fridge. Custard will thicken slightly more as it cools to room temperature. Do not freeze. See note 3 for suggested uses.
https://www.recipetineats.com/greek-meatballs/, Grate the onion straight into a large bowl; then add remaining Meatball ingredients. Use your hands to mix well for a few minutes until the mixture is quite smooth and very well combined. Optional: Refrigerate for 1 hour – makes them easier to roll + retains round shape when cooking. Measure out heaped tablespoons and dollop onto a work surface – should make around 32 – 35. Then roll into balls. Heat most of the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat (medium if you have a strong gas stove). Use enough oil to cover the surface of the skillet. Cook in 2 to 3 batches: Dredge meatballs lightly in flour; shaking off excess; then place in the skillet. Roll them around and cook for 5 – 6 minutes; until nicely browned all over. Remove onto plate; cover to keep warm and repeat with remaining meatballs. BAKING: Alternatively; spray generously with oil (preferably olive oil) then bake at 180C/350F for 20 minutes or until browned. The pan frying method is the traditional way and the meatballs are slightly juicier. Serve as a starter as part of a mezze platter with pita bread and tzatziki; or make dinner plates by adding a salad like a Greek Salad!
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-chicken-alfredo-pasta/, Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Use a skillet large enough to fit the pasta. Heat oil over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook for 2 minutes on each side until golden and cooked through. Remove onto plate and rest for 5 minutes; then slice while pasta is cooking. Add milk; chicken broth and garlic. Bring to simmer then add pasta. Move pasta around every 30 seconds or so until it is softened (around 3 minutes) so it doesn’t stick. Once pasta is softened; reduce heat to medium and stir every couple of minutes. At about 9 – 10 minutes; the pasta should be almost cooked but there should still be liquid covering the base of the skillet. Add cream and parmesan and mix.  Simmer; stirring occasionally; for ~2 minutes; until sauce is thickened and pasta is cooked. If you cook it too long and the sauce goes gluggy; add a splash of hot tap water – will go back to silky with a few tosses. Adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately; garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley!
https://www.recipetineats.com/asian-steak/, Take the steak out of the fridge 20 minutes prior to cooking (or 10 minutes if it’s a stinking hot summer day). Combine soy sauce; Mirin and sake in a small bowl. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat until smoking. Add steak and cook to your liking. Mine were 150g/5oz each and 3cm/1.25″ thick and I cooked it 3 minutes on the 1st side and 2 minutes on the second side for medium rare. Transfer steak onto a plate and cover loosely with foil. Rest for 5 minutes. Let the skillet cool down a bit then return to the stove over medium high heat. Add Sauce and bring to simmer; then add butter. When the butter melts and is incorporated into the sauce; immediately remove it from the stove. Stir through garlic; ginger and 2 tsp of shallots (reserve rest for garnish); the sauce should be slightly thickened (if not; keep stirring; thickens more as it cools). Place steak on plates and spoon over sauce. I served the steaks with finely shredded cabbage without dressing (very typical Japanese side) and white rice; plus some edamame on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-bean-soba/, Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking (or 15 minutes if it’s a stinking hot summer day). Combine dressing ingredients in a jar and shake. Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat until smoking; then cook the steak to your liking. I like mine medium rare – perfect for absorbing the flavours of the delicious dressing – so I cook this rump steak for 2 minutes on the first side and 1 minute 45 seconds on the second side.  Transfer to a plate and loosely cover with foil. Rest for 5 minutes; then slice into fairly thin slices against the grain (i.e. find the direction of the fibres then cut at a 90 degree angle straight through them). Meanwhile; bring a pot of water to boil. Cook the soba according to packet instructions (usually 5 minutes). For the last 1 minute of cooking; add the green beans. Drain the noodles and beans and rinse under cold water to stop them from cooking further and to cool the noodles. Roughly separate beans from noodles. To serve; divide the noodles between 2 bowls; top with the beans then the steak slices. Drizzle with the dressing (over the steak and noodles); then garnish with shallot slices and Crispy Asian Shallots.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fresh-strawberry-bars/, Preheat oven to 180C/350 (fan forced). (Note 1) Spray a 20cm/9″ square tin with oil and line with baking/parchment paper with overhang (so it can be lifted out once cooked). Mix together flour; oats; sugar; baking powder and salt. Add butter and egg then mix. Measure out 1 cup of the mixture (for topping) and set aside. Place remaining mixture in the tin and press into base.  Mix together Strawberries; sugar and cornflour in a bowl (don’t do this in advance because sugar will make strawberries sweat = runny filling). Spread base with jam (Note 2); then scatter over strawberries. Use your hands to crumble the remaining mixture over the top (Note 3). Bake for 35 – 40 minutes or until the top is deep golden. Remove and allow to cool for 10 minutes in the tin before lifting out of the tin using the baking paper. It will sag – don’t worry; it will set. Cut into squares. Serve at room temperature. Store in airtight container (in fridge if it’s very hot where you are).
https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-cinnamon-swirl-quick-bread/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all oven types). Grease a loaf tin approximately 21 x 11 cm / 8″ x 4″ and line with baking paper; leaving overhang (see video). Place Dry Ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. Place Wet Ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk until combined. Place Cinnamon Sugar ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine (it should be like a slurry; see video). Make a well in the Dry Ingredients bowl. Pour in Wet Ingredients; then mix 12 – 15 times until just combined (few lumps ok; see video). Spoon about 1/4 of the batter into the tin (about 1.5cm / 3/5″ deep) and smooth surface. Dollop about 1/3 of the Cinnamon Sugar over the batter. Top with half the remaining batter. Dollop the remaining Cinnamon Sugar over the batter. Drag a butter knife back and forth (lengthwise and cross wisto make the swirls. Top with remaining batter – dollop it on; the more the Cinnamon Sugar is moved about; the more swirls! Bake uncovered for 45 minutes. Then remove and cover with foil; and bake for a further 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Stand in the tin for 5 minutes before lifting it out onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool before slicing (can still be warm but don’t slice while hot; may crumble). Moist and flavoursome enough to eat plain but a little extra butter doesn’t hurt!
https://www.recipetineats.com/cashew-chicken-meatballs-recipe/, Place Sauce Part 1 ingredients in a jar and shake well. Place 2 tsp Sauce into a large bowl that you will be making the Meatballs in. Then add the cornflour into the Sauce jar and shake. Set Sauce aside. Add remaining Meatballs ingredients into the bowl. Mix until just combined. Measure out a heaped tablespoon of mixture and dollop onto a work surface. Then roll into balls (see Note 2 if mixture is too loose / sticky to form into balls). Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add meatballs and cook; browning as best you can all over; or at least on both sides. Once browned all over (about 4 minutes); carefully transfer onto a plate. They will still be a bit raw inside. Return skillet to the stove; still on medium high. Add onion and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Add capsicum and cook for 1 minute. Add Sauce and water and quickly mix – it will simmer quickly. Transfer meatballs (and juices on the plate) into the Sauce. Turn heat down to medium and simmer; stirring occasionally; for 3 – 4 minutes; or until the Sauce reduces and thickens (by which time the meatballs will be cooked). Stir through cashews; serve over rice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/pan-fried-gnocchi-with-pumpkin-spinach/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F. Place pumpkin in a large bowl; drizzle with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat; spread out on tray and bake for 20 – 25 minutes; turning once; until golden and soft inside. Set aside. Bring a large pot of water to the boil; add a good pinch of salt. Cook gnocchi according to packet directions; or until gnocchi pops to the surface of the water (see video). SCOOP OUT a large mug of cooking water; then drain gnocchi. Place butter in a skillet then put on the stove over medium high heat. Once it foams; add gnocchi immediately. Stir; turn up the heat to high; then leave to cook for about 30 seconds.  Add garlic and sage; then stir / toss for no longer than 1 1/2 minutes (i.e. 2 minutes in total – see note 2) until gnocchi is golden on both sides. Add about 3/4 cup of gnocchi cooking water and toss – the water will evaporate quickly and transform into a sauce. Then add the pumpkin; spinach and about 1/4 cup of cooking water. Stir quickly ; then season with salt and pepper. Toss then serve immediately with freshly grated parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sticky-chicken-drumsticks-in-chinese-plum-sauce/, Place Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag (or bowl) and mix. Add chicken and massage to coat in the Marinade. Refrigerate for 1 hour (see Note 3 for skipping this). Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all types). Line a tray with baking paper / parchment paper (or foil then spray with oil). Transfer chicken to tray; shaking off excess marinade. RESERVE Marinade. Bake chicken for 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Spoon / slather / brush with reserve marinade (generously!) (Note 4). Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and TURN chicken. Baste again using tray juices and reserved marinade. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and baste again (very generously!) using tray juices and reserved marinade. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove chicken from oven and scrape/brush tray juices onto chicken (don’t waste free flavour!). Sprinkle with sesame seeds and shallots/scallions if using. I served it with rice and steamed broccolini.
https://www.recipetineats.com/salami-cream-cheese-roll-ups/, Place the cold cream cheese on a large piece of cling wrap. Cover with another piece of cling wrap. Use a rolling pin to roll it into a rectangle about 32cm / 13″ x 23 cm / 9″. (Note 2) Peel off the cling wrap. Cover with salami; slightly overlapping. Cover salami with a new piece of cling wrap. Press down then turn over so the cream cheese side is up. Peel cling wrap off to expose cream cheese. Sprinkle with capers and parsley. Starting from the long edge; roll up; removing cling wrap as you go (see video below). Roll firmly to avoid air bubbles. Once rolled; wrap with the same cling wrap; twist the ends and refrigerate for 4 hours+. Unwrap from cling wrap. Slice into rounds. Serve with crackers.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-satay-chicken-stir-fry/, Cut chicken in half length wise then slice thinly. Place in a bowl with baking soda; use fingers to coat. Set aside for 20 minutes. Rinse well; pat dry with paper towel then place in a bowl. Mix together Seasoning. Sprinkle 1 tsp of Seasoning over chicken. Mix to coat then set aside for 10 minutes (not critical; can skip this). Place all ingredients except water in a bowl. Add remaining Seasoning. Mix; then add water and mix. Heat oil in wok or skillet over high heat. Add onion and garlic; stir fry for 1 minute. Add chicken and stir fry for 2 minutes until just cooked through and a bit browned. Lower heat slightly; then add Sauce. Stir fry until it reduce down and becomes thicker – 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately with rice – or for a low carb; low cal option; try Cauliflower Rice! Garnish with sliced shallots/scallions if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-mango-ice-cream-recipe/, Dice the flesh of the mango (see video for how I do it). Puree using a blender; food processor or stick blender then measure out 2 cups of mango puree (about 2 1/4 cups of diced mango). Pour puree into a non stick skillet over medium low heat. Cook; stirring constantly; for 8 – 10 minutes or until it reduces by half. The test is when you can drag a wooden spoon across the skillet and the path remains there for a second (see video). Or measure out the puree to ensure it’s reduced to at least 1 cup – less is even better! Cool puree. Combine cooled mango and condensed milk in a bowl. Add food colouring if using. Whisk until combined. Beat cream with a hand held beater or stand mixer until stiff peaks form (see video). Take a scoop of cream and put it in the mango mixture. Fold through until mostly combined – lumps is fine (this is just to lighten it up a bit). Then pour the mango mixture into the cream. Fold through (see video) rather than mixing vigorously like you would cake batter; until lump free. This will take a few minutes. Pour into a container (preferably with a lid). I recommend glass; if you can; or other non reactive container. Place a piece of baking / parchment paper on the surface. Then place lid on or using cling wrap. Freeze for 12+ hours. Remove parchment paper. Stand for 5 minutes to soften slightly; then scoop and serve! If frozen for 24 hours or longer; it will need a couple of extra minutes to soften to a scoop able consistency.
https://www.recipetineats.com/asian-salmon-salad/, Cut salmon into 2.5cm / 1″ cubes. Mix Sauce in a medium bowl. Add salmon; set aside for 3 minutes. Mix Dressing ingredients in a jar. Shake very well (jar is best). Divide Salad ingredients between 2 bowls. Heat oil in a non stick medium skillet over medium high heat. Remove salmon from Sauce; shaking off excess. Reserve Sauce. Place salmon in skillet. Cook for 2 minutes; turning to caramelise as many of the sides as you can (all sides is not practical; too much turning). (Note 5) Pour Sauce into skillet. Cook for 30 seconds or until the Sauce reduces to a syrup (see video for how it bubbles). Remove from stove. Immediately transfer salmon onto Salad. Leave to rest / cool for a few minutes.

https://www.recipetineats.com/middle-eastern-rice-mejadra/, Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Add about 1/3 of the onions and cook for 5 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining onions; in two batches. Put the olive oil; cumin seeds and coriander in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook for a couple of minutes until the spices are fragrant. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil and spices. Add the water and lentils. While it comes to boil; add all the other spices; salt and pepper. When it comes to a boil; turn it down to medium-low; cover with lid and let cook for 10 to 12 minutes; or until all the liquid has mostly been absorbed. Remove from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes - during this time; any residual liquid will absorb. Fluff rice with a fork and adjust the seasoning with more salt if you wish. Just prior to serving; stir through most of the onions and top with remainder. Sprinkle with chopped coriander if desired. Best served warm.
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-bbq-pulled-pork-sandwich/, Mix together Rub then rub all over the pork. Optional: Marinate for 1 hour. Place in the slow cooker and pour over apple cider.

OPTIONAL: Roast pork for 20 – 30 minutes at 180C/350F until browned (Note 4). Meanwhile; make BBQ Sauce. Shred pork with forks – it should be fall apart tender (see video). Toss in BBQ sauce – use as much as you like; the recipe makes enough to coat the pork well but not dripping in sauce; plus a bit extra on the side. To make Pulled Pork Sandwiches; pile pork on warmed rolls and top with Coleslaw. I like to lay everything out for people to make their own. Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat and whisk. Bring to simmer; then turn down the heat so it simmers gently. Cook for 1 hour. Remove from stove and use per recipe.
https://www.recipetineats.com/steak-sandwich/, Garlic Aioli: Mix mayonnaise and garlic together. Set aside for 30 minutes+ for the flavour to develop (do not keep for more than 3 days tops). Caramelised Onion: Melt butter in a skillet over medium low heat. Add onions and stir to coat in butter. Place lid on (or place a baking tray over skillet) and leave for 20 minutes; stirring once or twice. Remove lid then cook for a further 20 minutes; stirring every now and then; until onion is golden (increase heat slightly if the colour is not changing). Add sugar; vinegar; salt and pepper. Cook for a further 10 minutes until jammy. Remove from heat and keep warm. Take beef out of fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Season generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over high heat (or heat BBQ). Cook steak to your liking – if using a secondary cut like Bavette; skirt or flat iron; it’s best medium rare. Transfer beef to a plate; cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 – 10 minutes. Then slice thinlyagainst the grain. Cut turkish bread into 15cm/6″ lengths and split into half. Toast lightly. Spread the bottom piece generously with garlic aioli. Top with rocket; then tomato slices; beef; caramelised onion. Spread the top piece of bread with mustard then place on top.

https://www.recipetineats.com/spinach-and-ricotta-rolls/, Take pastry out of freezer. Place spinach in a colander and use a wooden spoon or your hands to press out excess water. You could also do this using a tea towel or paper towels. Transfer spinach to a bowl (drink the liquid; it’s good for you!). Add remaining Filling ingredients. Mix to combine. Place pastry on work surface and cut in half to create 2 rectangles – you should have 6 in total. Divide filling between pastries; brush edge with egg then roll up; finishing with the seam side down. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Meanwhile; preheat oven to 180C/350F. Spray 2 x baking trays with oil (any). Cut rolls into 4; or whatever size you want. Brush tops with egg (makes it golden) then sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 25 minutes; then take out the top tray and move the bottom tray to the top and give it an additional 5 – 10 minutes to make it golden. Best served warm – the pastry is crispier and the filling is juicier. See notes for make ahead instructions.
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-italian-chicken-orzo-risoni-pasta/, Mix Marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Add chicken and mix to coat. Marinate for 1 hour – 24 hours (See Note 3 to skip marinating). Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook for 4 minutes on each side; or until cooked. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm while resting. Turn heat up to medium high. Add oil if required. Add onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add capsicum and cook for 1 minute or until onion is translucent. Add risoni; tomato; chicken stock; Italian herbs; red pepper flakes; salt and pepper. Mix and bring to simmer; then lower heat to medium low or so it simmers gently. Cook for 9 – 10 minutes; stirring frequently (otherwise it will stick). Take it off the stove when the risoni is just cooked (touch under is ok; finishes cooking in residual heat very quickly). It should still be saucy (see video). Stir through parmesan and basil – excess liquid will evaporate in this step. Spoon risoni into serving bowls; top with chicken. Serve with extra parmesan and basil.
https://www.recipetineats.com/rosemary-garlic-grilled-lamb-chops/, Mix Marinade ingredients in a bowl until salt dissolves. Add lamb; mix to coat; then marinate at least 2 hours; preferably overnight; up to 24 hours. Brush BBQ bars with oil if required (Note 1) and heat to medium high (or heat 1/2 tbsp oil in skillet on stove on medium high). Cook lamb to your taste. I had 4 x 150g/5oz lamb loin chops about 2cm/3/4″ thick and 3 minutes on each side = medium. I also cooked smashed garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs for garnish. Transfer lamb to plate; cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 minutes. Serve with sides of choice!
https://www.recipetineats.com/no-washing-up-ham-egg-cheese-pockets/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all oven types). Place 2 pieces of foil on a work surface and spray with oil (any). Place tortilla on foil. Place ham in the middle of the tortilla; making sure you arrange it so it is flat; not a mound (harder to keep egg in place). Even better; create a shallow crater shape using off ham off cuts and shavings. Place cheese in the middle of the ham; the form into a ring. Working quickly (one pocket at a time); crack an egg into the ring then fold the bottom and top edges in; then the left and right side to form a package (see video below recipe). Then wrap in foil. DO NOT TURN UPSIDE DOWN!!! (Egg will leak) Place on baking tray. Bake for 25 minutes. Check to ensure yolk is cooked by poking the pocket; you will feel the dome shape of the yolk. The base and edges should be crispy and the top will be soft. Unwrap immediately (otherwise will sweat and lose crispiness). Serve hot!
https://www.recipetineats.com/festive-baked-brie/, Unwrap brie and place on a small microwave-proof plate with a rim (so maple syrup doesn’t go everywhere). Microwave on high for 1 minute 15 seconds; or until the brie is very soft when you prod the centre. Watch the brie as you microwave it – if it starts to puff up too much (i.e. risk of bursting); turn microwave off and leave brie inside – residual heat will continue to melt it. Top with pecans; pomegranate seeds and maple syrup. Serve immediately with crackers of choice (choose ones suitable for scooping). I serve this with a spoon and/or small pate knife.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pavlova-recipe/, Separate the whites and yolks while eggs are cold. Measure 150 ml/5oz egg whites (just shy of 2/3 cup; 140 – 160ml is ok). Set whites aside to come to room temperature. Preheat oven to 170°C/340°F (180°C fan-forced). Place whites in a bowl. Use a stand mixer (I use speed 7) or handheld beater (high) and beat until soft peaks form (Note 2) Add sugar 1 tbsp at a time; beating as you go. (Note 3) After adding the sugar; beat for a further 3 minutes or until thick and glossy. Rub a little of the fluff between your fingers; there should be no sugar grit – that means it is ready. Add cornflour and vinegar; beat on low for 5 – 7 seconds (or fold through with spatula) until just mixed through. Get the base of a springform cake pan (24cm/9.5″ or larger) and turn it upside down. Dab meringue on the edge and place a piece of baking paper (parchment paper) on top. Gently place half the fluff onto the paper. Use the cake pan as a guide to make it round and coax it into a circle shape around 20cm / 8″ in diameter (Note 5). Carefully scoop out the remaining fluff. Now coax it into a dome shape (not a cake with straight smooth sides) with edges sloping in slightly. Flatten top. Make it 4-5cm / 2 ” high – not much higher. (Note 5). See video / photos in post. It will rise/expand. Transfer to baking tray. CAREFULLY place in the oven; GENTLY close the door and turn oven DOWN to 115°C/240°F (100°C fan). Bake for 1 1/2 hours – no peeking; no thundering through kitchen! (Note 6) Turn oven off; leave the door closed and leave Pav in the oven overnight to cool (I’ve done 18 hours). Transfer Pav to serving platter then slide cake pan out from underneath. Use butter knife if required to loosen edges from paper; then slide paper out from underneath. Just before serving; top with cream and fruit of choice. Serve and be a rock star! Place cream; sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Beat cream until it is thickened and just holds its shape – don’t overbeat; it should be silky smooth; not speckled with bubbles and stiff.

Add sauce and cook for 3 – 5 minutes; or until most of the sauce has reduced. Divide noodles between bowls. Top with pork; coriander and fresh cucumbers on the side. To eat; mix up the noodles and pork. I use chopsticks and a spoon – so it’s easier to get the pork and noodles in one mouthful. Don’t hold back on the chilli paste! It goes great with this dish!
https://www.recipetineats.com/oven-baked-chicken-quesadillas/, Place Chicken ingredients in a bowl and mix to coat chicken. Heat oil in skillet over high heat.

Add to same bowl. Set aside until the filling cools (to speed it up; cover and refrigerate; and/or spread out on plate). Preheat oven to 220C / 430F (standard) or 200C/390F (fan / convection). Spray baking tray lightly with olive oil. Heat in the oven while you assemble the quesadillas. Divide the filling between the tortillas; covering half the surface. Top with cheese. Fold in half and press down gently but firmly. Remove baking tray from oven. Transfer quesadillas onto tray (you should hear a soft sizzle). Bake for 8 minutes. Then turn the quesadillas (over the folded edge) then press down with the egg flip. Bake for a further 8 minutes or until the surface is crispy. Remove from oven and serve immediately!

Right at the end when the risotto is ready; add a splash of chicken broth to make the risotto to make it slightly soupy; then take it off the stove. KEY STEP: Add butter (the more the better!) and parmesan; then stir vigorously (activates the starch and makes it super creamy). The excess liquid will evaporate quickly; so add more if you want a soupier risotto; like what you get at posh restaurants. Serve IMMEDIATELY!!

https://www.recipetineats.com/5-ingredient-sticky-stove-top-balsamic-drumsticks/, Combine all ingredients (including Extra Flavourings; if using) in a large skillet/fry pan or pot (Note 3) over medium high heat. The chicken should be in a single layer. Bring to boil; turn chicken; then turn down to medium so it simmers energetically but not rapidly. DO NOT cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 20 minutes; turning the chicken at 10 minutes. At 20 minutes; the chicken should be cooked. Move the chicken to the side of the skillet; propping and stacking them up on the edges of the skillet to clear the surface of the liquid as much as possible so it can reduce. Simmer for 5 minutes or until the liquid thickens (consistency of thick pouring cream) and coats the chicken. Keep an eye on the sauce; once it starts to thicken it will reduce quickly; don’t let it go too far. Roll the chicken in the glaze. Remove the skillet from the stove and stand for 5 minutes – the sauce will thicken slightly more. Roll the chicken in the glaze again; then serve; garnished with parsley or scallions if desired.

Continue 1 cup at a time until the risotto is just cooked - squeeze a grain; it should still be firm but cooked through - about 15 minutes. Make the risotto as saucy (or not) as you want - liquid will absorb in the next step so lean towards saucier than what you want. When the risotto is done (Note 5); remove it from the stove. Add butter (the more the better!) and stir energetically - this will activate the starch and make it creamy. Stir chorizo in then partially stir kale through the risotto. Plonk the lid on and let it rest for 3 minutes (kale will wilt in this step). Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately! (Note 6)

If you would like to toast the tortillas (highly recommended if you are using corn tortillas)* heat a pan over medium-high heat. Once hot; warm each tortilla 1 to 2 minutes per side – you want to heat the tortillas just enough to slightly char and add a bit of crispness; but not so much that when you fold it; it cracks. Wrap the tortillas in a clean tea towel to keep warm and set aside. On a large plate; combine all of the spices to make the blackened seasoning. Dredge both sides of each fish fillet in the spice mixture. In a large saute pan; heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. At the first wisp of smoke from the pan; add the fillets; working in batches if needed. Cook for 2 -3 minutes on each side. (Do not move the fish fillets around while they're cooking. Leave them be until they're ready to flip). Transfer the cooked fillets to a cutting board and slice each fillet in-half; vertically - making 8 pieces. To serve; top each tortilla with the fish; avocado-lime slaw; jalapeños; cilantro; and drizzle with the Sriracha aioli. Serve with extra wedges of lime and enjoy!

https://www.recipetineats.com/shredded-mexican-beef-burritos-freezer-friendly/, Microwave half the tortillas very briefly to warm them up (15 seconds or so). This ensures they don't crack when you roll them. Place 1 tortilla on a workbench - cover the rest with a tea towel to keep them warm. Place cheese down the middle of the tortilla; then top with 1/3 cup of beef; some corn; beans; then 1/4 cup rice. Roll the burrito up. (Note 2) Wrap in foil to hold it together. If you are serving it immediately; heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the burritos for around 4 to 5 minutes on each side to make the tortilla brown and heat the inside through. If freezing; place in the freezer. To reheat; you can either bake from frozen (with foil on) at 350F/180C for about 40 to 45 minutes; or thaw and cook in the skillet per above. You could microwave it (remove the foil) but I like my burritos a bit crispy!
https://www.recipetineats.com/whole-egg-bacon-and-avocado-quesadilla/, Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the bacon and cook until cooked to your liking. Remove bacon onto a paper towel lined plate. Drain excess fat from the skillet and wipe away/scrape off any black bits. Return to the stove over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet. Place avocado slices around the rim of half the tortilla and thinner slices across the middle to form a “ring” to hold the egg – as per the photo below. Squish the pieces close together to seal them so egg does not leak. Crack an egg into the centre; sprinkle with bacon; cheese and season with salt and pepper. Fold the tortilla over and cook for 4 minutes or until golden and crisp. I usually cook 2 in the skillet. Flip; turning over the folded edge (i.e. slide the flip under the curved edge and flip over the folded edge). Cook the other side for 3 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove from the skillet. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Serve immediately; while hot!

Leave in the blender with the lid on to keep warm. Place the butter and garlic in a small silver saucepan or small silver fry pan over medium heat. After a few minutes; the butter will start to foam. Then it will begin to turn brown; begin to smell nutty and little brown flecks will appear. When the garlic is a golden brown colour; transfer to a small bowl (I pick them out with chopsticks). When the butter turns a golden brown colour; remove from the stove. Carefully pour the butter into the bowl with the garlic; leaving the brown specks in the saucepan (they are a bit bitter). You should have about 2 tbsp of browned butter. Heat a skillet over high heat (no oil). Add the prawns and cook for 50 seconds or until the underside has just a hint of golden brown.

Lightly whisk together the egg white leftover from the Cheese Spread (above) with the remaining 4 eggs. Cut the puff pastry in half. Use a knife to score a 1cm / 1/3" border (see photo below). (Note 1) Transfer to baking tray. (Optional) Dip a brush into the egg mixture and lightly brush over the border (makes it extra golden). Spread the Cheese Spread within the border. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden and the edges are puffed. The cheese centre will bubble and puff up while in the oven; but will settle down once out of the oven While the pastry is baking; make the Toppings (below). Remove from the oven. (Note 2) Divide the scrambled eggs between the tarts; staying within the border. Top with mushrooms then pile the bacon on. Bake for a further 5 minutes or until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown. Remove from oven and serve immediately! Melt butter in a non stick frypan over medium heat. Add the eggs and leave them for 20 seconds until starting to set; then slowly start folding them in from the outside in. Stir gently and continue folding until just set but still wet.

https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pan-prosciutto-wrapped-ricotta-chicken-with-scalloped-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Mix together the Ricotta Filling ingredients in a small bowl. Lay out the prosciutto on a work surface. Place chicken lengthwise at the bottom of each strip. Divide Ricotta Filling between the chicken; placing it at the bottom (closest to you). Roll up the chicken; wrapping it in the prosciutto; finishing with the seam side down. Not too tightly otherwise the ricotta will ooze out! Use toothpicks to seal the ends.

https://www.recipetineats.com/garlic-butter-cauliflower-pasta-with-pangritata/, Dice the bread into small pieces - you want (at least!) 1/2 cup. Spray generously with oil. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the bread crumbs and saute for about 2 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the skillet into a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Return the skillet to the stove. Melt the butter then add the oil. When hot; add the smashed garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the cauliflower. Cook; stirring occasionally; for around 3 minutes; then add the red onion and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes; until the cauliflower is beautiful golden brown but still a bit firm. Remove the smashed garlic cloves. Meanwhile; cook the pasta in salted boiling water - 1 minute less than the recommended cooking time on the packet! RESERVE 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta or use tongs to transfer it directly to the skillet. Pour the reserved pasta cooking water into the skillet along with the red chili flakes; a good pinch of salt and pepper. Gently toss the pasta for 1 to 2 minutes; until the water evaporates - you will be left with a luscious coating of sauce on each strand of pasta (this is called emulsification) and the cauliflower will finish cooking. Remove from the stove. Grate over zest of 1/2 the lemon and drizzle over about 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Toss quickly. Serve; sprinkled with Pangrattato with freshly grated parmesan and parsley; if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chorizo-baked-beans-on-toast/, Dice most of the chorizo; leaving some in slice form if you want to use them for garnish like I did.

Cook for 5 minutes; stirring occasionally until thickened but still very saucy. Remove from heat. Lay a tortilla in a pie dish (24 cm / 9 inch diameter). Use a slotted spoon to top with just under 1/2 the meat. Try to avoid using too much sauce so sort of "shake" each spoonful to drain out sauce. Top with another tortilla + torn/cut pieces of another tortilla to cover completely. Top with the remaining meat; again avoiding the sauce. Top with remaining tortillas; then pour over all the sauce (and any residual meat). Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. If you're worried about overspill; place it on a baking tray. Remove from the oven; cover with corn chips then scatter with cheese. Bake until the chips are a bit golden and the cheese is melted - 10 to 15 minutes. Serve; topped with Pico De Gallo and Sour Cream on the side; if using. Combine ingredients in a bowl. Toss and adjust salt/pepper to taste.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sweet-soy-sauce-shredded-chicken-breast/, Slow Cooker: Place all the Shredded Chicken ingredients in the slow cooker and cook on low for 5 hours (or 2 1/2 hours on high). Pressure Cooker: Place all the Shredded Chicken ingredients in the pressure cooker. Cook for 35 minutes on high. Stove: Place all the Shredded Chicken ingredients in a saucepan large enough for the chicken to fit snugly in one layer. Add 1/2 cup extra water so the chicken is mostly; but not completely submerged. Cover and simmer for about 50 to 60 minutes; turning once or twice. The chicken is ready when it can be easily shredded with two forks. Remove the chicken from the liquid and shred it while it is warm. Set aside and cover to keep warm. Transfer the liquid from the slow cooker / pressure cooker to a saucepan and bring to simmer. (Note 3) Reduce to around1 1/4 cups - it should only take a few minutes. Mix together the Sauce Thickening ingredients and add to the saucepan. Simmer until it it thickens to a syrup consistency. Toss the chicken in the sauce and serve over rice. (Note 4)
https://www.recipetineats.com/30-minute-homemade-ricotta-gnocchi-from-scratch/, Mix – Put all the gnocchi ingredients in a bowl except the flour. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to mix until combined (smear up the wall if needed; to help cream the ricotta). Add flour – Add 3/4 cup of flour and mix until just combined so it is a very sticky dough that will hold its shape in a mound; but is not runny and stir-able like a batter (see video for consistency). Stickier dough = softer gnocchi! Use the remaining flour; 1 tbsp at a time; if needed; but try to stick with 3/4 cup. (Note 3) Logs – Sprinkle a work surface with flour then scrape the dough out onto it. Sprinkle the surface lightly with flour then use your hands to bring the dough into a disc about 2.5cm/1" thick. Cut it into 8 wedges. Roll and cut – Roll each piece into a log 25cm/10" long; about 1.25cm / 1/2" wide. Cut into 1 1/2 cm / 3/5" pieces (I cut 4 logs at a time).(Can freeze at this point – Note 4) Boil – Bring a large pot of water to boil. Tumble the gnocchi in and cook for around 2 1/2 minutes; or until the gnocchi is floating on the surface for around 30 seconds. Drain – Reserve 1 mug of cooking water. Then drain and add the gnocchi into the frypan with your sauce of choice (you only need one of them; not both). Follow the instructions below. Melt the butter in a large fry pan over medium high heat. Let it bubble until it turns brown. Add the salt and pepper. If the gnocchi isn't ready yet; remove from the stove until ready. Add gnocchi – Pour the cooked gnocchi into the fry pan along with 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water. Gently stir; coating the gnocchi in the melted butter; cooking for 1 minute. This is the step when the butter and starch in the water emulsify so the sauce coats each piece of gnocchi. Do a taste test and add more salt if required. Serve immediately. Sauté – Heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and onion. Sauce for 3 to 5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add the remaining ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. Do a taste test and adjust saltiness to taste. Add the gnocchi and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water. Cook for 1 minute; stirring gently. The olive oil and starch in the water will emulsify to thicken the sauce so it clings to the gnocchi better. Serve immediately as the gnocchi will start to harden after about 15 minutes as it cools. You can reheat in the microwave to soften. Garnish with freshly grated parmesan and parsley; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/smoked-salmon-and-egg-breakfast-mille-feuille/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F.

Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Then brush the puff pastry with the eggs; taking care not to brush the cut sides (optional step - makes the pastry more golden). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes; or until puffed and golden. Remove from the oven and split each piece in half horizontally (so you have a top and bottom). Place on a rack to cool. Whisk the cream into the eggs. Melt butter in a pan over medium heat if you have gas or medium high for electric. Don't let the butter brown. Add the eggs and don't touch it for 20 seconds. Then use a wooden spoon with a flat edge (or egg flip) to gently scrape the bottom and fold the eggs over. Continue to do this for 30 seconds to 1 minute; until the eggs are mostly cooked but still wet. Turn the stove off; add salt and pepper and keep folding until the eggs are just before done to your liking (they will continue to cook for a bit). Remove from the stove. Mix the crème fraîche and chives together in a small bowl. Place the bottom half of each puff pastry piece on a serving platter.

Serve the chicken with the zucchini salad and toasted bread. Add the 1 tablespoon of olive oil (from the Zucchini Side ingredients) into the jar with the remaining Dressing Marinade and shake well. Set aside. Toss the zucchinis and mint with the Dressing Marinade.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-and-bacon-bread-boats/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Heat a non stick pan over high heat. Cook the bacon until lightly browned; then drain on a paper towel and set aside. Whisk together the eggs; cream and salt and pepper in a jug. Cut a "V" shape out of each baguette. Pull some bread out; leaving about 1/2" / 1.25cm thick base. Brush crust of the bread with melted butter. (Optional - this makes the bread extra golden and buttery) Place the bread on a baking tray. Carefully pour half the egg mixture into the crevice of each baguette. Leave it for a couple of minutes to soak into the bread a bit. Divide the bacon and shallots between each baguette. Then sprinkle over half the cheese (reserve the other half to put on top). Carefully pour the remaining egg mixture into each baguette. Pour slowly; giving the egg time to sink into the filling. Top with remaining cheese. Bake at 350F/180C for 20 to 25 minutes; or until light golden brown on top and the egg does not "jiggle" when you shake the baguette. Serve whole or sliced.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-shrimp-prawn-noodle-salad/, Combine the Garlic Shrimp ingredients in a small bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. Combine the Dressing ingredients in a small jar; give it a shake then set aside for 10 minutes. Heat a skillet / fry pan over high heat. Add the shrimp; scraping in the olive oil and garlic from the sides of the bowl. Cook for 2 minutes; or until browned and the shrimp is just cooked through. (Note 2) Remove the prawns from the skillet onto a plate. Prepare the vermicelli noodles according to the packet directions. I like to just soak them in hot tap water for a few minutes; this ensures they don't overcook. Then drain the noodles. Arrange the noodles and remaining Salad ingredients on a large plate (like the photo) or toss together in a bowl. Top with prawns (warm or at room temperature). Drizzle over the Dressing (or toss through); or you can serve the Dressing on the side. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-orzo-risoni-bolognaise/, Heat the oil in a large skillet/fry pan (or pot) over medium high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 3 minutes or until translucent. Add the mince and turn the heat up to high. Cook the mince; breaking it up as you go. When the mince is browned; add the remaining ingredients except the orzo. When the liquid comes to a simmer (it might bubble and spit slightly) add the orzo/risoni. Give it a quick stir then turn the heat down to medium low. Cook for 10 minutes; stirring frequently towards the end to ensure the orzo/risoni doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. If your liquid is evaporating too quickly; just add a slosh of hot water (tap or boiling). Remove the risoni from the heat. The risoni should be a teeny bit hard still and it should be very saucy when you take it off the stove. (Note 2) Check for seasoning (salt); then give it a good stir. Serve immediately; while it's piping hot and nice and saucy; garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-garlic-baked-ricotta/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place the ricotta in a bowl. If you are using supermarket ricotta (as opposed to fresh Italian ricotta); it might be a bit dry. Use the cream or milk to loosen the ricotta into creamy "peanut butter" type consistency (ie. easily spreadable). Add the lemon; garlic and salt and mix to combine. Get to 1 cup capacity ramekins or any other oven proof dish (I used tapas dishes). Divide the ricotta between the dishes and drizzle over 1 tbsp olive oil (reserve other tbsp for after baking). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the top is lightly browned. Remove from oven; drizzle with remaining 1 tbsp olive oil then serve immediately with toasted pieces of bread (tip: rub lightly with garlic - it's amazing!). Fresh thyme; parsley or any other herbs; finely chopped (pictured) Chopped tomatoes; red onion and parsley (pictured) Finely chopped antipasto (eg olives; sun dried tomatoes)
https://www.recipetineats.com/bacon-wrapped-hot-dogs-with-cheese-sauce/, Toss together the cheese and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients EXCEPT the milk and cook over medium heat; whisking occasionally for the first couple of minutes then frequently as the cheese melts. Whisk until the Cheese Sauce is smooth (about 5 minutes). Remove from the stove and let it cool to room temperature. Whisk vigorously every 5 minutes or so to blend the "skin" that forms on the surface into the Cheese Sauce. Once it is at room temperature; use the milk to make the consistency suitable for dolloping onto the hot dogs. Trim the edges of the bacon so they wrap neatly without overlapping. Lay a strip of bacon on a work surface. Place a hot dog on the bacon on the diagonal. Then roll up the hot dog in bacon. Use a toothpick to secure each end. (See photo below) If you are cooking the hot dogs on the stove or flat iron side of the BBQ; use scissors to trim the toothpicks so they aren't sticking out. (Note 2) Brush the grill side with oil and drizzle the remaining oil on the flat iron side of the BBQ. Then heat on medium high (or do this in a frypan over medium high on the stove). On the flat iron side; add the onion and cook until dark golden brown. Cook the extra Bacon for Garnish at the same time (if using). On the grill side; cook the hot dogs; turning until nicely browned all over. Partially cut the hot dog buns. Place a bacon wrapped hot dog in the bun; top with onion; a generous amount of Cheese Sauce and Bacon for Garnish (if using).
https://www.recipetineats.com/nutella-stuffed-pancakes/, Line a baking tray with baking paper (parchment paper). Dollop 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp of Nutella onto the baking tray and spread into a disc around 2 1/2" / 6cm in diameter and 1/5" / 1/2 cm thick. (Note 1) Repeat to make 7 discs. Place the tray in the freezer until firm (around 1 to 1 1/2 hours). Peel off the parchment paper. Keep the Nutella discs in the freezer until required (they soften quickly). Place the Dry Ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. Make a well in the centre and place the Wet Ingredients in the well. Whisk until combined and lump free (stop whisking as soon as it is smooth; don't over whisk). Melt 1/2 tsp butter in a non stick fry pan over medium heat. Once melted; wipe most of the butter off with a paper towel. (Note 2) Take 3 Frozen Nutella Discs out of the freezer just before you start cooking. (Note 3) Dollop 1/4 cup of batter into the fry pan. Working quickly; place 1 Frozen Nutella Disc in the middle of the batter; then top with batter to cover the Nutella disc (Note 4). When bubbles start appearing around the edges (around 2 minutes); lift up the edge and make sure the underside is golden. Then flip and cook until the other side is golden. Repeat with remaining batter. Melt more butter in the pan after the 3rd or 4th pancake. You should be able to make 7 in total; but sometimes it makes 6 - depends on how much batter you use on top of the Nutella. Serve warm with sliced strawberries; if using. You could also serve with cream but I find that it's not necessary!
https://www.recipetineats.com/shrimp-prawn-pad-thai-spice-i-am-restaurant-easy-homestyle/, Place the rice noodles in a bowl and cover with lukewarm water and set aside for 1 hour.

(Note 2) Toss the Roast Potato ingredients in a bowl. Remove the tray from the oven and pour the potatoes onto the tray. Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes. (Note 3) Combine the Beans ingredients into bowl you used for the potatoes (so residual butter sticks to beans) and toss. Remove salmon from the Marinade; reserving the Marinade. Remove tray from the oven. Move the potatoes to one side and place the salmon in the middle; skin side down. Pile the beans into one corn of the tray (don't spread them out; they will overcook). Sprinkle over the salt and pepper all over everything on the tray. Drizzle some Marinade on each salmon; then place the tray into the oven and bake for 4 minutes per 1/2 inch / 5 minutes per 1.5 cm of thickness (thickest part of the salmon).

https://www.recipetineats.com/red-velvet-cupcake-cookie-with-cream-cheese-frosting/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Line two cookie sheets with baking (parchment) paper. I streak the tray with a bit of butter to make the paper stay in place. Use a mixer or handheld beater to cream the butter; vanilla extract and sugar until light and fluffy - around 3 minutes on high. Add the eggs; sour cream; cocoa powder and red food colour and mix until combined. Add the flour and baking powder and mix until just combined. Drop heaped tablespoons of batter onto the baking tray; spacing them out around 1 inch / 2.5cm from each other and the edge of the tray.

Generously butter a 10cm x 21cm / 4" x 8" loaf tin Make Cream Cheese Filling - beat (or mix) the cream cheese; sugar and vanilla until combined. Then add the egg and lemon juice; then beat/mix until smooth; light and fluffy. Whisk the Egg Mixture ingredients together in a large bowl. Dip 2 slices of bread into the Egg Mixture. Because you're using fresh bread; it should soak through with egg mixture pretty quickly. Line the base of the loaf tin with the egg dipped bread. Cut bread if necessary to fill in gaps. Repeat twice more so you have 3 layers of egg dipped bread. Spread all the Cream Cheese filling over the bread. Then top with two more layers of egg-dipped bread. Dot surface with butter and scatter over the sugar. Bake for 40 minutes until golden and puffed. Check at 30 minutes - if the top is already dark golden; then cover loosely with foil and return to the oven to finish baking (this is what I did). Allow to rest for 15 minutes in the tin before turning out onto a cooling rack to rest for a further 5 minutes. To serve; topped with Macerated Strawberries. Combine strawberries and sugar in a bowl and set aside to "sweat" for at least 20 minutes.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheesy-jalapeno-bacon-stuffed-baguette-with-garlic-butter/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Heat oil in a pan over high heat. Add bacon and cook until lightly browned. Remove onto a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess fat. Set aside to cool. Cut the ends off the baguette and cut the baguette in half (or quarters - makes it easier to stuff). Use a long knife (preferably bread knife) to cut the bread out; leaving about a 1/2" / 1.5cm wall of bread and crust. (Note 2) Place the bacon; cream cheese; cheddar and mozzarella cheese; jalapeños; scallions/shallots and pepper in a bowl and mix until combined. Use a knife or piping bag to stuff the mixture inside the baguettes. Garlic Butter: melt butter with the garlic and salt in the microwave or on the stove. Brush the baguette with garlic butter (or you can do this after you slice it). Slice the baguette into 1 1/4cm / 1/2" slices. Keep the slices pressed up against each other; and transfer to a large piece of foil. Wrap the baguette; then bake for 15 to 20 minutes; or until the bread is crusty and the cheese inside is melted. For optimal experience; serve warm!
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-greek-chicken-lemon-rice/, Combine the Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag and set aside for at least 20 minutes but preferably overnight. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Remove chicken from marinade; but reserve the Marinade. Heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil in a deep; heavy based skillet (Note 2) over medium high heat. Place the chicken in the skillet; skin side down; and cook until golden brown; then turn and cook the other side until golden brown. Remove the chicken and set aside. Pour off fat and wipe the pan with a scrunched up ball of paper towel (to remove black bits); then return to the stove. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in the skillet over medium high heat. Add the onion and sauté for a few minutes until translucent. Then add the remaining Rice ingredients and reserved Marinade. Let the liquid come to a simmer and let it simmer for 30 seconds. Place the chicken on top then place a lid on the skillet (Note 3). Bake in the oven for 35 minutes.

Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving; garnished with parsley or oregano and fresh lemon zest; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sausage-and-egg-stuffed-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Cut the lid off the potatoes and scoop out the flesh. If the potatoes are cold; pop them in the oven to warm up while it is preheating. (Note 4) Heat 1/2 tbsp of olive oil in a fry pan over high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned; using a wooden spoon to break the sausage up into little pieces (as small as you can). Optional step: Brush the outside of the potatoes with melted butter or olive oil - for extra flavour and crispiness. Fill the potatoes with sausage; pressing down to compress as much as you can (this prevents egg sinking into the sausage). Crack the egg on top; sprinkle with cheese; then place in the oven to bake for 18 to 25 minutes; or until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Check it at 15 minutes then take a peek every 5 minutes - I find that it can go from uncooked to overcooked quickly. My oven was heated well and my potato was piping hot so it took 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately; sprinkled with parsley if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-dreamy-cauliflower-soup/, Place all Soup ingredients (except salt and pepper) in a large pot over high heat and bring to boil; then turn down to medium and let it simmer for 10 to 15 minutes; or until the cauliflower is very soft. Use a hand held blender and blend until smooth (Note 1); then add salt and pepper to taste. If the soup is too thick for your taste; add more milk; water or stock (and more salt if needed). If you want it even thicker; let it simmer on the stove for a while longer to reduce down and thicken (be careful not to reduce it so much that it is too salty). Serve; garnished with fresh thyme leaves and drizzled with cream and/or olive oil; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/spinach-ricotta-puffs/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Spray 2 standard muffin / cupcake tins with oil. Place egg in a bowl and lightly whisk. Add remaining Filling ingredients and mix to combine. Taste and adjust salt to taste. Cut each pastry into 9 equal pieces (18 in total). You probably won't use 3 pieces. Mould 15 pieces of pastry into the muffin tins. Divide the Filling between each; then bring the four corners into the centre and press down to stick together. Don't overfill otherwise you won't be able to seal the pastries or they will burst open when baking (which regularly happens with mine). Brush with egg wash; then bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until deep golden brown. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before removing. Serve warm or cool.
https://www.recipetineats.com/magic-3-layer-custard-cake/, Preheat oven to 325F/160C (standard oven / fan forced or convection) Butter a 8" x 8" / 20cm x 20cm square cake tin (Note 4). Beat egg whites with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside. Place the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat until it turns pale yellow - about 1 minute. Add the vanilla extract and butter and beat until well incorporated - about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the flour and beat until just combined. Pour the milk in slowly while beating; and beat until well combined (or if using a hand held mixer; add 1/4 milk at a time; beating in between). Use a spatula to fold in the egg whites in the batter; one third at a time; until just incorporated. You don't want to knock the air out of the egg whites. Don't worry if there are a few egg white lumps in the batter. The batter should be very thin; almost like a thick pouring cream. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin. Bake until the top is golden brown and the cake does not "jiggle" when you gently shake the tin - around 40 to 50 minutes. Check the cake at 30 minutes - if the top is already golden brown but the cake is not yet set (i.e. it jiggles); cover loosely with foil and return to the oven; 10 minutes at a time; until set. Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes; then turn out onto a cooling rack.(Note 3) Cool completely before serving. Cut into squares - I cut it into 12 in the photo; but 9 is more realistic serving size portions. Dust with icing sugar just before serving. Serve with a side of whipped cream and strawberries; if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cuban-pork-sandwich-cubanos-from-chef-movie/, Heat skillet over medium heat. Add ham and pork slices; and cook each side until slightly browned then remove to a plate. Butter cut sides of baguettes then place in the skillet; cut side down; for 2 minutes until lightly browned. Remove onto work surface. Layer the bottom of the baguettes with pork; ham; then cheese and pickles. Cut; break or fold the ham; pork and cheese so they fit.

https://www.recipetineats.com/juicy-cuban-mojo-pork-roast-chef-movie-recipe/, Combine Marinade ingredients in a food processor and blend until the herbs and garlic are finely chopped. Alternatively; you can finely chop/mince the garlic and herbs then mix all ingredients in a bowl. Place in a large ziplock bag with the pork. Place in the fridge overnight (in a bowl; just to be safe). Remove the pork from the Marinade and leave on counter for 1 hour (bring to room temp). Reserve the Marinade. Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Roast; uncovered; for 30 minutes. Base with pan juices. Reduce heat to 190°C/375°F (170°C). Roast for another 1 1/2 – 2 hours; basting every half hour; until the internal temperature reaches 70°/160°F. At this temperature; the pork is cooked; still juicy; and carvable; as it is intended to be (Note 1) Fall-apart tender alternative (not slicable; meat falls apart): Roast at 160°C/320°F (all oven types) for 3 1/2 hours; or until the meat can be easily shredded using 2 forks (check on side). Remove from the oven and place on a plate; loosely covered with foil. Rest for 20 minutes before serving with the Mojo Sauce on the side. I decorated mine with pan fried slices of oranges and extra cilantro/coriander leaves. Place the reserved Marinade; Mojo Sauce ingredients and 2 tbsp of the roasting pan drippings into a small saucepan. Bring to boil and add salt and pepper to taste. You might also want to add more lime juice or even a touch of sugar. Turn the heat down and simmer for 1 minute; then remove from the stove and set aside.
https://www.recipetineats.com/ester-restaurant-cauliflower-with-almond-sauce-easy-chef-recipe/, Place the almond meal; water and 2 tbsp of olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat until the almond meal starts to swell - around 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the almond mixture into a blender or small food processor and whiz until smooth. Add brown rice vinegar and salt and whizz to mix. With the blender running; add the egg yolks then pour the oil in a thin stream. Keep whizzing while you pour and the sauce will become thick and creamy. Taste to check the salt and pepper; then set aside (keep at room temperature). Cut the cauliflower into quarters (leaving most of the outer leaves on). Cut off a bit of the core; otherwise it won't cook through because it is thicker (see photo below). Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the cauliflower; bring back to boil then boil for 3 minutes. (Alternatively you could steam it.) Drain and leave the cauliflower to steam dry for 10 minutes. It also continues cooking. Preheat the grill/broiler on high and place the rack around 20cm/8" from the heat source. Drizzle the cauliflower with olive oil then place under the grill/broiler for 5 minutes until nicely charred; then turn the cauliflower and char the other side for a few minutes. Remove the cauliflower from under the grill/broiler and drizzle with lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread about 3/4 cup of the Almond Sauce on a plate. Place the cauliflower on top; sprinkle over the almonds and mint. This can be served warm or at room temperature.

Cook for around 20 minutes; until all the water is absorbed (tilt the saucepan – if there is no water; then it is ready). Remove from the stove and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. During this time; any residual water will be absorbed and the rice will continue to cook. I served this with Jamaican Jerk Chicken Drumsticks.
https://www.recipetineats.com/brownie-cookie-sandwich-peanut-butter-frosting/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Line two baking trays with parchment / baking paper. Pour 1" / 2.5cm of water into a large saucepan or small pot and bring to a simmer over medium low heat. Place a bowl over the simmer water and melt the butter and 10oz/300g chocolate chips. Stir until smooth. While the chocolate is melting; place the eggs; cocoa powder and sugar in a bowl and beat for 3 minutes on high (using an electric beater or stand mixer with the whisk attachment). Pour 1/3 of the melted chocolate into the egg mixture and mix well; then pour the remaining melted chocolate in and mix again. Add the vanilla; salt and baking powder and mix until combined. Add the flour and mix until just combined - do not over mix. Fold in 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips. See image below for batter consistency. To make large ones like I did; drop 2 tbsp of mixture onto the baking tray; leaving 2"/5cm between each cookie. To make normal sized ones; use 1 tbsp of mixture per cookie. (Note 1) Bake large cookies for 15 minutes for very soft or 17 to 20 minutes for firmer cookies. Bake small ones for 10 to 12 minutes for very soft; or 15 minutes for firmer. (Either way it is still moist!) Allow to rest on the baking tray for 5 to 10 minutes before carefully transferring to a cooling rack. Place all ingredients except the cream in a stand mixer bowl with the paddle attachment. Beat for 5 minutes on high; or until creamy. Scrape down the sides as you go. Add the cream then beat for a further 2 minutes; or until the frosting is fluffy. This can also be done using a hand held beater but it will take a few minutes longer. Spread Peanut Butter frosting on a cookie; then sandwich with another cookie. Repeat with remaining cookies.

https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-apple-pie-fries-salted-caramel-dipping-sauce/, Place Apple Pie Filling; sugar and cinnamon in the food processor and whizz until smooth. Working quickly so the pastry does not defrost; place one sheet of pastry on a cutting board or other flat surface. Spread the filling over the pastry; leaving a thin border. Place the other sheet on top. Brush with egg wash; sprinkle with sugar granules (if using) then place the pastry in the freezer for at least 1 hour (Note 3). Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Spray large baking tray with oil (or 2 small ones). Remove pastry from the freezer. Let it defrost for 5 to 10 minutes; until the pastry is softened - it doesn't need to thaw completely but it can't be frozen stiff otherwise it will crack when you cut it. DO NOT let the pie filling defrost! Use a large knife to cut it into "fries". I cut mine into 12 strips vertically (2cm / 4/5" wide) then 3 horizontally (8cm/3" long) to make 36 fries. Carefully transfer to baking tray and set them aside to come to room temperature while the oven heats up. Bake for 15 to 25 minutes; until golden brown on top. (Note 4) Remove from oven; let it rest for 5 minutes then transfer to cooking rack. Serve with Salted Caramel Sauce. Place sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat. Swirl the pan to help the sugar dissolve easily but do not stir. Let it come to a rapid simmer and cook for around 3 to 4 minutes until it turns a light golden brown. Remove from heat and CAREFULLY and slowly pour the cream in (it will bubble and froth slightly pour slowly). Whisk to combine. Then add the salt and butter and whisk again. Serve with Apple Pie Fries.
https://www.recipetineats.com/italian-sausage-quiche/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Lightly spray a 9"/23cm quiche flan or pie dish with oil. Line with the pastry; trimming the excess. Use the extra 1/2 sheet to fill in any gaps as 1 sheet of pastry is slightly too small for a standard flan. Press to seal well. Cover pastry with parchment (baking) paper; then fill with raw rice or dried beans to weigh it down. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes; then remove parchment paper and rice/beans. Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes until golden. Remove from oven. Heat oil in a fry pan over high heat. Add the garlic and onions and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add the sausage and cook; using a spatula to break it up into pieces. Cook until the sausage is browned; then remove the pan from the stove (sausage can stay in the pan). Whisk the eggs; milk; herbs; salt and pepper in a bowl until combined. Scatter half the cheese in the pie crust; then most of the sausage mixture. Pour over the egg mixture; top with remaining cheese and sausage. Then gently place the cherry tomatoes on the surface (cut side down). Carefully transfer to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown on top and the filling has set. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Let it simmer for around 5 minutes to let the flavours come together and the liquid to reduce. Stir occasionally. Add Sauce Flavourings into the tomato passata bottle and shake to combine. Remove fry pan from the stove. Slide one lasagna sheet; starting from the side; under the Filling - this will be the base of the lasagna. Use a spoon to push it down and cover it in Filling. Break up pieces of lasagne and slide them in under the filling around the sides of the pan (to form the remainder of the bottom layer); using a spoon to push them down and cover with Filling. Cover the Filling with the remaining lasagna sheets. Pour over the Sauce and spread over the top. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover with a lid or foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake for a further 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly and golden. Remove from oven and set aside for 10 minutes to set. Sprinkle with parsley (if using); then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/spicy-parmesan-party-popcorn/, Pop the popcorn in a popcorn maker or on the stove (see steps 2 and 3). Make popcorn on the stove: Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add a few pieces of popcorn - if the corn slowly spins in the oil then the oil is hot enough. Add remaining popcorn and cover with a lid. Once the popcorn starts popping; shake the pot gently every now and then. Remove from heat when the popping stops (when you can count to 3 between pops) and transfer to a large bowl. Combine the salt; cayenne pepper and paprika in a small bowl and mix to combine ("Spice Mix. Get a large serving bowl and place 1/3 of the popcorn in it. Spray generously with olive oil then sprinkle over 1/3 of the parmesan and 1/3 of the Spice Mix.Repeat twice more. Do not toss. The flavourings will naturally toss through as people start to dig in.

https://www.recipetineats.com/truly-crunchy-roast-potatoes/, Pour the oil in a metal or cast iron baking dish and place in the oven. Crank up your oven to as high as it will go (mine is 250C/480F fan forced). Boil a large pot of water. Peel and cut the potatoes into large pieces; about 6cm/2.2″ wide. (Note 4) Boil the potatoes for 10 minutes. Drain then return to the pot. Scatter over the semolina and salt. Clamp the lid on and give the pot 5 good shakes to rough up the potatoes. Leave the lid on and set aside. The oil should be hot enough by the time the oven comes to temperature. Test it by tossing in a pinch of potato – it should sizzle straight away. Pour the potatoes in (be careful of oil splashing). Working quickly; use an egg flip to toss the potatoes in the oil; spread them out as best you can then put the pan to the oven. Turn the oven down to 220C/425F. Roast for around 50 minutes; possibly up to 1 hr 15 minutes (Note 5); turning once during baking. They are ready when they are a golden brown with some browned edges and they are crunchy. (Note 6) Serve immediately! They will stay crunchy for around 30 minutes; but the faster you get them on the table; the better! They also crisp up pretty well when reheated – reheat @220C/425F for around 15 minutes (from room temp; add 5 min from fridge).

https://www.recipetineats.com/satay-chicken-with-peanut-sauce/, Cut the chicken into 1.5cm/0.5″ cubes. Thread onto skewers – 4 to 5 pieces per skewer. Combine kecap manis and butter; then brush onto chicken. Cook the skewers on a hot BBQ (outdoor grill) or on the stove in a large non stick fry pan (add a splash of oil; and make sure the skewers will fit in the pan). Grill/broiler would also work. Serve; garnished with crushed peanuts; shallots and with lime wedges and Peanut Sauce on the side. Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic; onion and chillis and cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent. Turn heat down to medium; then add peanut butter; coconut milk; kecap manis; soy sauce and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes; whisking occasionally. Use a handheld stick to puree (so the onion and chilli blends throughout the sauce – this is key). (See Note 2 for blending instructions) Stir through crushed peanuts and lime juice and simmer for 2 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving or to room temperature – it will thicken.
https://www.recipetineats.com/man-candy-candied-bacon-nuts/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Line a baking tray with baking paper (parchment paper). Cut the bacon into 1.5cm / 0.6" pieces (remove rind if it has it). Combine with remaining Candied Bacon ingredients in a bowl and use your fingers to coat the bacon. Combine the Candied Nuts ingredients in a bowl and toss to combine. Spread the Candied Bacon onto a baking tray and bake for 10 minutes; or until the sugar is bubbling and the bacon is starting to turn brown (i.e. almost cooked). Remove the bacon from the tray using a slotted spatula (so you don't get too much bacon fat) and transfer it into the bowl with the nuts. Mix to combine. Use a spatula to scrape and pour the excess oil off the parchment paper (this is what I did). Pour the nuts back onto the baking tray and bake for 15 minutes; stirring once at half time. Turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Leave for at least 15 minutes; then remove and allow to cool. Break the candy into chunks. To store; place into an airtight container and keep in the refrigerator. (Note 4)

Preheat oven to 160C/325F. Pour beer into the baking dish and cover with a lid (use foil if you don't have a lid). Place in the oven and cook for 1 hour. Meanwhile; make the Sauce. Take out of the oven and remove lid. Pour the sauce over the ribs; then return to the oven (uncovered). Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes; turning once or twice; until the ribs are cooked to your liking. The meat should be very tender and comes off the bone easily; and the sauce should be thick and "jam-like". If the pan starts looking dry; add a splash of water. To finish the ribs off; grill/broil for 5 to 10 minutes to get a nice browned finish on top (this is an optional step). Serve; garnished with fresh coriander/cilantro leaves and wedges of lime. Blend or process the canned tomato in a food processor; Chipotle in Adobo Sauce; onion and garlic. Stir through remaining ingredients. Set aside until required.

Add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is translucent – around 5 minutes. Return the beef to the pot along with all other Filling ingredients other than the cornstarch / cornflour and water. Mix to combine. The liquid should be just enough to cover most of the beef but there should be a bit protruding through the surface. Bring to a simmer; then lower the heat to low / medium low so it is bubbling very gently. Leave to cook for 50 minutes to 1 hour; stirring occasionally; or until the beef is very tender. Because the beef is cut so small; it shouldn’t take much longer than 1 hour. If the liquid evaporates too quickly; just add a bit more water. When the beef is ready (or almost ready); mix the cornstarch / cornflour and water together then pour it into the pot. Mix through and allow to cook for 5 minutes to thicken the sauce. Adjust salt to taste. Remove pot from the stove and set aside to cool. The sauce will thicken more when it cools. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Spray 16 holes of Texas muffin tins or pie tins (8cm / 3.2″ diameter across top). I made half in muffin tins and half in pie tins. Cut the pastry base out of the shortcrust pastry using a 10 cm/ 4″ round cutter (I use an empty 800g/14oz canned tomato tin – perfect size). This fits both the pie and muffin tins. Press the rounds into the tins and fill to the brim with the Filling. Cut the pie tops out of the puff pastry using a 8 cm / 3.2″ round cutter (a scone cutter is the perfect size). Place the lids on top of the filling; gently pressing to try to join the top with the casing. Pearce the lids 3 or 4 times with a small knife. Brush with egg wash. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until dark golden brown (or deep golden brown if you used a whole egg for the wash). Allow to rest for a few minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. Serve very warm with tomato sauce (tomato ketchup).
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pan-spanish-chicken-chorizo-tomato-potatoes/, Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Combine the Rub ingredients in a small bowl. Slather over the chicken. Boil or microwave the potatoes until slightly undercooked. Heat the oil in a large; deep fry pan or oven proof casserole dish over high heat. Add the chicken; skin side down; and cook unit light brown - about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Then turn and cook the other side until a slightly deeper brown - about the same time. Remove into a big bowl. Add the chorizo and fry until light brown on each side - about 1 minute (each side). Remove into the same bowl as the chicken. If the pan is looking dry (depends on fattiness of chicken and chorizo); add 1 tbsp of olive oil. I did not need this. Add the garlic; capsicum (bell pepper) and onion and sauté for 2 minutes until the capsicum is slightly charred. It will be extra charred from the dark brown residue from the chorizo and chicken. Add the canned tomatoes and oregano and stir to combine; scraping the bottom of the pan. Then add the potato; chicken; chorizo and cherry tomatoes. Nestle the chicken in so it is half submerged in the tomato. Bring to simmer; then cover with a lid (I use a lid from a large pot) or foil and bake for 30 to 40 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and dark brown. Serve; garnished with fresh oregano leaves if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-prawn-shrimp-pasta-restaurant-style/, Peel and devein the prawns; keeping the tails in tact. (Note 1) Discard the vein and place the heads and shells in a saucepan or pot to make the stock. (Note 2) Cut the larger prawns lengthwise in half. Add 2 minced garlic cloves the minced garlic and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Use your fingers to gently coat the prawns. Cover and set aside to marinate while you make the stock. Add the remaining stock ingredients into the saucepan/pot and place over high heat. Bring to boil then turn down to medium / medium high and let it simmer rapidly. Get a potato masher and "crush" the prawn heads and shells (to extract maximum flavour). Do this a couple of times while it is simmering. When the liquid has reduced to around 1 to 1 1/2 cups; strain the stock into a bowl; then pour the stock back into the pot. (Note 3) Place lid on; then set the stock aside; keeping it warm until required. Bring a large pot of water with 2 tsp of salt to boil. Add pasta and cook until just before al dente (Note 4). While the pasta is cooking; heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large deep fry pan over high heat. Add the prawns and cook the first side for 1 minute; then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove onto a plate; loosely cover with foil and set aside. (Note 5) Add the remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil and 1 garlic clove (minced) into the fry pan. Scrape the residual oil and garlic from the bowl the prawns were marinating in as well. Return the fry pan to the stove and sauté until the garlic is fragrant. Transfer the cooked pasta into the fry pan (use tongs to transfer it from the pasta pot) along with 3/4 cup of the pasta water (this is a key step) and cherry tomatoes. Gently toss the pasta in the fry pan for around 1 minute. The water will thicken and turn into a glossy coating on the pasta. Add the lemon zest; lemon juice; parsley; chilli (if using) and prawns/shrimp. Quickly toss to combine; then pour over the stock and toss quickly to coat all the pasta. Then remove from heat immediately. Season to taste with salt and pepper (always do this last). Drizzle with extra olive oil; and serve immediately; with extra lemon wedges and fresh parsley if desired. Note: seafood pastas and risottos are not traditionally garnished with parmesan (in Italy); however; I say do as you wish!
https://www.recipetineats.com/taco-stack-with-pork-carnitas-or-chicken/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Prepare either the Pork Carnitas or Quick Mexican Chicken. Place the corn tortillas in the oven (I do it directly on the shelf) and bake for 3 to 5 minutes on each side; just to make them a bit stiff but not browned. Place a tortilla on a baking tray. Scatter 1/6th of the Pork Carnitas or Quick Mexican Chicken on the tortilla and top with Salsa (reserve some for Topping) then cheese. Place another tortilla on top and repeat; then again (so you end up with 3 layers of meat. Place the 4th tortilla on top. I don't put anything on it; but you could sprinkle some cheese if you want. Repeat with remaining 4 tortillas. Bake for 10 minutes until heated through and cheese is melted (it does not take long). Remove from oven. Top with remaining Salsa and Toppings of choice (I used sour cream; avocado; jalapeño and coriander/cilantro) Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the corn and sauté for a couple of minutes until charred to your liking. (This step is optional) Allow to cool slightly; then toss with remaining Salsa ingredients. Defrost (if using frozen); then heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large fry pan over high heat. Add Pork Carnitas and cooking until the underside is golden brown (do not flip - Note 4). Remove from pan (scrape up all the brown bits) and set aside. Combine all ingredients other than the oil in a bowl and toss to combine. Heat the oil in a large fry pan over high heat. Add the chicken and sauté until browned and cooked through. Remove chicken from the fry pan. Allow to cool then either roughly chop into smaller pieces or use a fork to "shred".
https://www.recipetineats.com/grilled-eggplant-with-yoghurt-sauce/, Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Set aside for the flavours to develop. The longer you leave it; the better it will taste. Use a potato peeler to peel "strips" off the eggplant vertically as per the photo below. If your potato peeler is not sharp enough or if the eggplant is on the soft side; you might need to do this with a small sharp knife. Cut the eggplant into 1.5cm / 2/3" thick rounds. Brush one side of each eggplant with olive oil. The more you use; the yummier it will be! Sprinkle the oiled side of the eggplant with salt and pepper. Heat a griddle pan (or BBQ) on medium high heat. (Note 5) Place the oiled side of each eggplant onto the pan and grill for 2 to 3 minutes until it gets deep char lines on it. While the first side is cooking; brush the other side of each eggplant with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Turn the eggplant and cook the other side until the eggplant is cooked through but still holding it's shape. The easy way to tell is to prod the centre - if you feel resistance; it needs to cook more. Remove the eggplant onto a serving plate and let it cool for a few minutes. Then spoon a dollop of the yoghurt sauce on each; and scatter with coriander/cilantro; mint; pomegranate seeds and chili. Drizzle with extra olive oil and serve with cheeks or wedges of lemon; if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-saucy-creamy-mac-cheese/, Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Melt the butter in a deep fry pan or skillet (Note 4) over medium heat. (Note 5) Add the flour and stir until combined so a thick paste forms ("roux"). Cook; stirring constantly; for 1 minute. Add half the milk and use a whisk to dissolve the roux into the milk. It will thicken quickly; then add the remaining milk. Whisk in small circles; rotating around the pan; to dissolve all the roux into the milk. Add the water; salt and 5 grinds of pepper; then turn the heat up to medium high. Whisk leisurely so the bottom doesn't stick to the pan. When the white sauce starts to steam and thickens such that you can see it coating the edges of the pan (around 2 to 3 minutes); add the macaroni. Turn the heat down to medium and stir gently with a wooden spoon to mix the macaroni through and ensure the bottom doesn't stick. Cook it for 1 minute. Be sure not to cook it for longer than this after adding the macaroni - this really impacts the "sauciness" of the dish and ensuring the macaroni isn't overcooked. Cover the fry pan (Note 6); then transfer it immediately to the oven on the middle shelf. Bake for 12 minutes; then remove from the oven. It will seem like there is too much sauce but it reduces and thickens in the next steps. The pasta should be just cooked (al dente). It will continue cooking from the residual heat. Turn the oven off and turn the grill/broiler on high. Stir through the cheese; just enough to disperse it through the macaroni. As you stir; this will melt the cheese and thicken the sauce. Don't stir too much because otherwise the sauce will thicken too much due to the evaporation. Sprinkle over the panko and parmesan cheese; then place under the grill/broiler for a few minutes to brown. Remove from the grill/broiler and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chorizo-bacon-smashed-potato-breakfast-hash/, Steam; boil or microwave the potatoes until soft. (Note 1) Cut the potatoes in half. Heat a skillet or fry pan over high heat. Add the bacon (add a dash of olive oil if you have lean bacon) and fry until browned but not crisp. Remove onto a plate with a slotted egg flip. (Note 2) Add the chorizo into the same fry pan and cook each side until browned; around 2 to 3 minutes. Remove on the plate with the bacon. (Note 2) Place the potatoes; cut side down; into the fry pan. Use the egg flip or a potato masher to "smash" the potatoes down so they flatten onto the fry pan. Sprinkle with salt. Cook the first side until golden brown - around 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Then turn and cook the other side until just golden brown; pressing down with the egg flip - around 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Sprinkle with salt. Add the bacon; chorizo and cherry tomatoes into the fry pan. Toss gently. Crack the eggs into the pan. Drizzle the water down the side of the pan; then put a lid on the fry pan (Note 3). The eggs will "steam cook". Cook until the eggs are cooked to your liking. For "just set" egg white with runny yolks; it is usually around 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the stove; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with sprinkle of parsley and avocado (if using). Serve with crusty bread or toast.
https://www.recipetineats.com/jamie-olivers-chicken-milk-seriously-delish/, Preheat oven to 190C/375F. Wash the chicken under water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle over the salt and 5 grinds of black pepper and pat all over the chicken; concentrating on the top and sides. Heat oil in a heavy based pot over high heat. (Note 1) Brown the chicken all over as best you can. I find the easiest way to do this (and minimising skin tearing) is with tongs stuck in the rear of the chicken and a wooden spoon to lift and leverage the chicken. Tilt the chicken as required to brown as much of the skin as you can. (Note 2) If you can manage it (or if you have a helper); pour the excess fat out of the pot with the chicken still in it. If you can't; remove the chicken onto a plate; then drain the fat. Add the remaining ingredients into the pot (return the chicken to the pot if you removed it). Bake covered for 40 minutes; then bake uncovered for 50 minutes (1.5 hrs in total). Let stand for 5 minutes or so before removing the chicken from the pot onto a serving plate. Serve the sauce on the side. I prefer not to strain it because I want the bits of curd and garlic on my chicken; as well as bits of sage.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-truffles-mini-cheese-balls/, Cream Cheese Filling - place ingredients in a bowl and mix well until combined. Adjust salt to taste. Feta Cheese Filling - place ingredients in a bowl and mix well until combined. Make the balls - measure out 1 tbsp of filling and use a teaspoon to scoop the filling out of the tablespoon and place onto a tray or cutting board. Once you have scooped out all the filling; use your hands to roll into balls. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours. Place the Coatings into small bowls. Roll the cheese balls in the Coatings. Refrigerate the cheese balls until ready to serve. Take them out of the fridge around 15 minutes before serving (so they are spreadable). Serve with crackers or pieces of toasted bread.
https://www.recipetineats.com/ham-potato-corn-chowder/, Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes until translucent. Do not let the onion brown. Add the flour and whisk until mixed through the butter. Pour 1 cup of milk in and whisk until it starts to thicken (around 1 1/2 minutes); then pour the remaining cup of milk in. Whisk until it thickens - around 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Then add the chicken stock; and 1 1/2 cups of water and whisk until combined. Increase heat to medium high and add the potatoes into the soup. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes (Note 3); whisking fairly regularly to ensure the soup doesn't stick to the bottom of the saucepan. The soup will thicken as it cooks. Use the remaining 1/2 cup of water if the soup gets too thick before the potato has finished cooking. Just before the potato has finished cooking; add the corn in (just to heat it through). While the potato is cooking; heat olive oil in a small fry pan over high heat. Add the ham and sauté for 1 - 2 minutes until nicely browned. Remove fry pan from the heat and set aside. (Note 4) When the potato is cooked (tender but still holding its shape); remove the soup from the stove and stir through most of the thyme and ham (reserve a bit for garnish). If the soup is too thick for your liking; use water (or milk) to get the soup to your desired consistency. Add the salt and 5 grinds of black pepper; then do a taste test and adjust the saltiness if required. Serve; garnished with remaining thyme leaves and ham.
https://www.recipetineats.com/croque-madame-toastie-cups-ham-egg-cheese-sauce/, Turn the oven on to 180C/350F. Cut the crusts off the bread; then roll out with a rolling pin until flattened. Press the bread into Texas muffin tins to form cups. Place into the oven (even if it is still heating up) for 5 minutes; just to dry the bread out a bit (Note 3). Don't let it brown. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium high heat. Add the flour and stir until a paste forms. Add half the milk and whisk until the sauce thickens - around 1 minute. Add the remaining milk; Dijon mustard; nutmeg; salt and pepper. Keep whisking because once the milk heats up; it thickens very quickly. Whisk until the sauce is thick enough to coat the spoon thickly (around 1 1/2 to 2 minutes); around the consistency of tomato ketchup. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. The sauce will thicken considerably as it cools. Then stir the cheese in. Brush the melted butter around the edges of the toast cups (to help them brown nicely). Divide the ham between the toast cups; then carefully crack an egg into each. Top with Bechamel Cheese Sauce; then sprinkle each with a pinch of grated cheese. Bake for 18 minutes (for runny yolks) to 23 minutes (firm yolks). (Note 4) Rest for a few minutes; then sprinkle with parsley and a grating of fresh nutmeg. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/make-ahead-creamy-mashed-potatoes-restaurant-trick/, Peel and cut the potatoes into large chunks. Bring a pot of water to the boil; then add the potatoes. Cook for 20 minutes until soft and starting to fall apart. Drain then tip back into the pot placed over the stove (turned off). Allow to steam dry for a few minutes. Mash to your taste. Do NOT use a hand held mixer; blender or food processor - it will activate the starches in the potatoes and make it gluey. To make ahead; transfer to a bowl and cover with cling wrap; pressing onto the potato to remove as much air as possible. Refrigerate up to 2 days until required. On the day of; place the cream and butter in a pot and bring to a boil. Turn the stove off but leave the pot on the stove. Add the potatoes and stir into the cream. If you want to make your potatoes creamier; push them to the side; add more cream/milk; turn the stove on; bring to a simmer then stir. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm; garnished with chopped chives; a drizzle of olive oil and pepper.
https://www.recipetineats.com/hasselback-baked-french-toast/, Cut the french stick loaf into 3 equal pieces. Cut slices into each piece around 1.5cm / 0.5" thick almost through to the base (like hasselback potatoes / classic garlic bread). Place the Egg Mixture into a bowl and whisk to combine. Place the Egg Mixture and bread into a ziplock bag or plastic bag. Remove as much air as you can and seal. Set aside for at least 1 hour (or overnight); turning once or twice; or until most of the Egg Mixture has been soaked up by the bread. (Note 1) Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place the bread into a baking dish (22 x 22 cm / 8 x 8"); cut side up. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Place the Butter Mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat until melted and combined; stirring occasionally. You could do this in the microwave too - around 2 x 30 second bursts; stirring in between. Remove the french toast from the oven. Pour the butter mixture over the french toast and return to oven. Bake for a further 5 to 10 minutes or until golden and crispy on top. Remove from oven and let it rest for 5 minutes. Sift over icing sugar (confectioners sugar) and serve with maple syrup.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pork-sausage-apple-stuffing-pancetta-cups/, Preheat oven to 350F/180C with the oven rack in the middle. Get 2 muffin trays and partially stack them so you have 16 muffin holes and the "joined" muffin tins will fit on one shelf (Note 4). Line the holes with pancetta. Heat a large fry pan over high heat. Add the pork sausage and cook it; breaking up the meat as you go. Cook until the sausage changes from pink to light brown and some of the bits starts to brown - about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage into a bowl and drain the excess fat. Return the pan to the stove and reduce the heat to medium high. Add the butter; and once melted; add the onion and celery. Sauté for around 3 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add the apple and almonds; and cook; stirring occasionally; for another 3 minutes. Remove the fry pan from the stove. Add the bread and gently stir to combine. Add the chicken stock/broth; cream; sage and thyme and sit to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the egg and stir until mixed through. Divide the mixture between the 16 pancetta cups. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes before serving. To make ahead; transfer to a cooling rack. Cover and refrigerate until required. Then reheat in a 180C/350C preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes until the pancetta and top is crispy.
https://www.recipetineats.com/festive-duck-apple-cider-drizzle-easy/, Preheat oven to 210C/410C. Place the onion; garlic and water in a baking dish; then place a rack on top. Rinse the duck under water; including inside the cavity. Use paper towels to pat dry. Or; if you have the foresight; rinse it the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight; uncovered; to dry out. Place the Spice Rub in a small bowl and mix to combine. Slather the Spice Rub all over the skin of the duck (not inside). Use most of it on the top and sides. Place duck on the rack and put in the oven. Roast for 20 minutes; then turn down the oven to 180C/350F. The total roasting time (including the initial 20 minutes) should be 40 minutes per 1 kg / 20 minutes per 1 lb of duck. To check if it is done; insert a skewer into the part where the leg meets the breast. If the juice runs clear; it is ready. Remove duck from the oven. Remove duck from the baking tray; loosely cover with foil and let it rest for 20 minutes. Place on a bed of rocket/arugula lettuce. Scatter with pomegranate seeds (Note 4) and serve with the Apple Cider Drizzle on the side. Pour all the fat; juice; onion and garlic in the baking tray through a sieve placed over a bowl. Use a spoon or potato masher to mush the onion and garlic so you can extract maximum flavour. If there is an excessive amount of fat floating on top of the juices; try to spoon it off (save it for roasting potatoes or vegetables; that stuff is gold!). Pour 1/4 cup of the juices into a small saucepan. Add apple cider vinegar; apple juice; chicken broth and place over medium heat. Bring to simmer and let it simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until it reduces by about 1/4; then remove from the stove. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Also; adjust tartness and sweetness to your taste with more apple cider vinegar or white sugar. Serve on the side of the duck.
https://www.recipetineats.com/red-green-white-christmas-salad/, Fill a large pot with water and bring to boil. Cut the woody ends off the asparagus; then cut the asparagus into 3. Separate the asparagus heads from the stems. Trim the beans and place in a separate pile. Remove the strings along each side of the snow peas. Place the beans in the boiling water. When the water comes back to the simmer again; leave the beans to simmer for 30 seconds. (Note 1) Add the asparagus stems in. Once it comes back up to a simmer; count 30 seconds again. Then add the snow peas and asparagus heads; bring it back up to a simmer and count to 30 seconds. Immediately drain the greens and run cold water over the greens for 10 seconds to stop the cooking process. Once cool; set aside to dry. Roughly dry with a paper towel if serving immediately. Combine the Dressing ingredients in a jar and shake well to mix. Place the greens in a bowl and toss with the Dressing. Transfer to a serving bowl; crumble over feta and scatter with dried cranberries. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/warm-red-cabbage-spinach-garlic-herb-butter/, Place the butter and garlic in a fry pan over medium high heat. Once melted; leave to sizzle for 15 seconds to allow the garlic to infuse the butter. Then add the salt and herbs; and swirl the pan to spread throughout the butter. Add the cabbage and cook; tossing in the butter to coat the leaves. Once the cabbage just starts to wilt; remove from the heat. Add the spinach and balsamic vinegar. Toss so the residual heat wilts the spinach slightly and the balsamic vinegar tosses through. Transfer onto a serving plate and scatter over pistachios. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/grilled-vegetable-platter/, Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. Set aside in the fridge until required. Heat the outdoor grill on high (hot plate side). Or a heavy based pan on the stove on high heat. Drizzle olive oil on the hot plate / fry pan. Place vegetables on the grill / fry pan and cook until charred (about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes). Turn over then cook the other side until charred (about 1 1/2 minutes). Don't worry if the vegetables are a bit undercooked; they will continue to cook while resting. Remove from the hot plate / fry pan and place in a bowl. Sprinkle the vegetables in the bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining vegetables; and pile the vegetables on top of each other in the bowl. Don't forget to add a pinch of salt and pepper on each layer of vegetables. Cover and let it cool to room temperature. If you are making this ahead; place the vegetables in the refrigerator until required. Bring to room temperature before serving. To serve; place the vegetables on a platter; drizzle over olive oil (the more generous the better!) then garnish with parsley/coriander leaves and lemon wedges (if using). Place the yoghurt on the side (garnish with a pinch of cumin powder) and serve with flatbread or crusty bread.
https://www.recipetineats.com/hash-brown-crust-quiche-lorraine/, Preheat oven to 425F/220C with the oven shelf in the top 1/3 of the oven. Grease a 9"/ 23cm pie dish (Note 2) If shredding potatoes yourself; peel and grate the potatoes. Place the shredded potatoes into a colander and rinse for 10 seconds; using your hands to move the grated potatoes around; until the water runs clear. Take a handful of the rinsed grated potatoes OR the thawed frozen shredded hash browns and squeeze the excess water out; then place into a large bowl. Repeat with remaining potato. You should have about 4 cups of shredded potato. Add melted butter and salt and mix to combine. Pour the shredded potato into the pie dish. Use a large dessert spoon to spread the hash browns over the base and side of the pie dish. Use your hands or a spatula to pat down the base of the hash brown crust so it is fairly firmly packed. Spray the hash brown crust with oil spray (I used olive oil spray). Bake the crust for 30 minutes. While the crust is baking; melt 1/2 tbsp butter in a fry pan over medium high heat. Add onion; garlic and bacon into the fry pan. Saute until the onion is translucent and the bacon is just starting to brown (but not crisp). Remove from the stove and set aside to cool slightly. Place Egg Mixture ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine. When the crust is light golden brown on the surface of the base and golden brown on the walls of the crust (around 30 minutes); remove from the oven. Scatter the bacon onion mixture across the base; then the cheese. Then pour the Egg Mixture in. Return the quiche to the oven and turn the oven down to 180C/350F. Bake for 25 minutes; or until the Filling is set. Test this either by inserting a skewer into the centre (it should come out clean) or by touching the centre gently (it should spring back). Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/aloo-paratha-indian-potato-stuffed-flatbread/, Place the flour; water and salt in a bowl. Use a table knife to mix the ingredients together; then use your hands. Once the dough is sort of formed; turn it out onto a work surface and knead it 60 times. It should be smooth and elastic; not sticky or crumbly. Form the dough into a ball; cover with cling wrap and set aside for at least 20 minutes (up to a few hours). Do not refrigerate. Meanwhile; make the Filling. Place all Filling ingredients into a bowl and mix to combine. Preheat oven to very low (to keep Parathas warm because you can only cook one at a time). Cut the dough into 4 pieces with a knife. Take one ball and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a round about 18cm/7" in diameter. Place 1/3 cup of the Filling into the middle of the rolled out dough. Gather the edges of the dough to enclose the Filling (see photo below). Remove as much air as possible from inside then pinch to seal. Flatten the ball slightly and shape the flattened disc into a circle using your hands. Turn the dough over so the "sealed" side is facing down. Use a rolling pin to roll it out to about 1 1/2 cm / 2/3" thickness. Repeat with remaining dough. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a non stick fry pan over medium heat. Place one Paratha into the fry pan and cook the first side for 1 minute 45 seconds. Use an egg flip to check if it is ready to turn - the underside should be golden brown. Turn the Paratha over and cook the other side for 1 minute 30 seconds. Remove from fry pan onto a wire rack (this stops the underside from going soggy due to sweat) and place into a low oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining Parathas. Add a small drizzle of the remaining oil into the pan (you should not need much). Proceed to cook the remaining Parathas. Cut into 4 pieces and serve immediately. It can be served with chutney or yoghurt on the side. I find that the Filling has so much flavour that it doesn't need anything on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/maple-bacon-pumpkin-tart-recipe/, Preheat oven to 220C/425F. Spray a baking tray with olive oil (or grease with butter or oil) Cook Pumpkin either by roasting or microwaving it (see instructions below). Transfer to a large bowl (cools faster) and add butter plus a pinch of salt and pepper. Mash with a fork until the pumpkin is smooth and set aside. Cut puff pastry in half (Note 3). Place one piece on top of the other. Place the double layered pastry on the baking tray. Cover pastry with a sheet of baking (parchment) paper (not weighed down; just place it on top of the pastry). Bake for 15 minutes until it has puffed up a bit and it is a very light golden brown. While the pastry is pre-baking; trim the bacon so it is wider than the width of the tart by approximately 1.5cm / 1/2" (Note 4). Remove the pastry from the oven and discard baking paper. Working quickly; spread the pumpkin on the pastry; leaving a 1cm / 1/4" border. Place the bacon on the tart; overlapping each slice. The 8 slices should cover the whole tart. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes until deep golden. Remove from the oven and brush half the maple syrup on the bacon and the pastry border. Place the tart back in the oven for a further 7 to 10 minutes; until the bacon and pastry is a deep; dark golden brown. (Note 5) Remove from oven and brush with remaining maple syrup. Season with pepper if desired. Serve with a light side salad. This tart reheats well in the oven and keeps for 2 days in the fridge; but it is best served fresh out of the oven. Roasting: Toss pumpkin in olive oil and roast for 20 - 25 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oven; then proceed with recipe directions. Microwaving: Place pumpkin in a microwave proof bowl (or steamer) with a splash of water. Cover with lid or cling wrap (pierce with a fork a few times if using cling wrap) then microwave on high for 8 minutes. Drain water before use; then proceed with recipe directions.
https://www.recipetineats.com/4-ingredient-crunchy-chicken-mashed-potato-cucumber-ribbon-tomato-salad/, Turn grill/broiler on high and place the shelf about 20cm/8" from the heat source. Place potatoes in the microwave and cook on high for 3 minutes. Then turn the potatoes over and cook on high for a further 2 minutes (or until cooked). Squeeze the potatoes to check if they are cooked. Mix the mayonnaise and parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Place the chicken in a large oven proof fry pan (Note 5). Using the back of a spoon; spread the mayonnaise mixture over each chicken breast. Sprinkle panko breadcrumbs over each piece of chicken. Use your fingers to pat the panko so it sticks to the chicken. (Note 6) Place chicken under the grill/broiler for 8 minutes; or until just cooked through and the crumbs are golden. Check it once at around 6 minutes and rotate the fry pan if necessary so the crumb cooks evenly all over. When cooked; set aside to rest for a few minutes before serving. While the chicken is cooking; get the potatoes out of the microwave (use a dishcloth). Cut each potato in half; then use a dessert spoon to scoop the flesh out into a bowl. Add milk; butter; salt and pepper. Use a potato masher to mash. Add more milk to achieve the desired consistency. Salad: Use a potato peeler to make ribbons from the cucumber. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Pile the cucumber and cherry tomatoes onto a plate; then drizzle over lemon juice; olive oil and scatter with salt and pepper. To Serve: Place mashed potato on each plate then top with the chicken. Drizzle with extra olive oil and garnish with finely chopped fresh parsley; if desired. Serve the Salad on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/strawberry-nutella-french-toast-roll-ups/, Combine Egg Mixture in a bowl with a flat base large enough to lie the roll up in. Whisk to combine. Spread sugar out in a small dish. Use a rolling pin to roll the bread flat. This makes them easier to roll up (and stay rolled up). Spread each piece of bread with around 3/4 tbsp of Nutella. Sprinkle strawberries along the bottom of each piece of bread. Roll up bread. The Nutella will keep it sealed. Melt butter in pan over medium high heat. Roll each roll up in the Egg Mixture; shake off excess then place in the pan. Repeat with remaining roll ups. Cook for around 4 minutes until each side is golden; rotating every 1 minute or so. Remove from pan and immediately place in the sugar. Roll to coat in sugar; then remove. Repeat with remaining roll ups. Serve immediately; while warm.
https://www.recipetineats.com/gingerbread-box-mason-jars/, Place butter; brown sugar and honey in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until the butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Set aside until almost at room temperature. (Note 1) Pour into a large bowl and add the egg. Mix until combined. Sift the remaining Gingerbread ingredients straight into the bowl. Mix until just combined; then use your hands to knead it a few times in the bowl to bring the dough together. (Or turn onto work surface if your bowl isn't large enough). Flatten dough into a disc; wrap in cling wrap and place in the fridge for 1 1/2 hours. (Note 2) Remove dough from fridge. For ease of handling; cut the dough into 2 pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll out to 3mm / 1/ 10" thickness between two pieces of baking (parchment) paper. See Note 3 for an easy way to do this. Proceed with instructions to make Boxes or Mason Jars. Preheat oven to 180C/350F with one oven shelf in the centre and the other directly below it. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper (parchment paper). Cut out 12 squares from the rolled out dough that are 8cm x 8 cm (3" x 3"). Place onto baking tray. Optional: Cut 2 x small squares to use as the "knob" in the centre of the lid. Place small squares in the centre of 2 squares. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown. The top tray will take around 12 minutes; the bottom tray will be closer to 15 minutes (move it to the upper shelf when you take out the first tray). Allow to stand for 5 minutes on the tray then remove onto cooling racks. Once the squares are cool; select 8 squares to be the walls of the boxes and line them up in front of you with the flat side down on the bench (i.e. the side that was on the baking tray). Use a knife to trim the bottom and right side of each square (to make the edges flat - easier to construct). Melt the milk chocolate buttons. Use a knife to spread melted chocolate on the right edge (that you trimmed) of one square (Square A). Hold Square A standing upright so the bottom edge (that you trimmed) is flat on the work surface. Get another square (Square B) and hold it upright so the bottom trimmed edge is on the work surface. Attach the chocolate edge of Square A to the flat side of Square B (i.e. the side that was on the baking tray). Hold for 20 seconds to let the chocolate firm up a bit. On Square B; use a knife to spread melted chocolate on the right edge you trimmed. Then attach that to another square; then repeat until you have constructed the walls of a box. Repeat for other box. While the walls are setting; get two more squares. Trim them with a knife so they are the right size to fit inside the walls - this will be the Base of the box. Spread a little chocolate on the edges of the square then pick up the walls and put it over the Base and push down so the Base fits inside the walls. Use Royal Icing to hide the edges and decorations of choice. I used Silver Sugar Balls. Attach the decorations while the Royal Icing is wet. Line 1 baking tray with baking paper (parchment paper). Press the open end of the can into the dough to cut out 2 rounds. These will be the base. Cut 2 x strips of baking paper that are at least the height of the can and are long enough so it will overlap when you wrap the can. Butter the baking paper then wrap around the cans. For cutting the dough: Cut a rectangle out of baking paper that is the height of the can and the length to wrap around the can with a 1 inch / 2cm overlap. **This is important. See Note 4.** Lay the rectangle from step 4 on the dough and use a large knife to cut out the rectangle. Repeat to make two rectangles. Leaving the dough on the baking paper it was rolled out on; place the can on one end of the dough and roll up firmly to cover the can. Make sure it wraps snugly; saggy dough will result in a saggy Mason Jar. Remove parchment paper; trim any excess dough and use your fingers to seal. Repeat with other can. Place the cans on their side on the baking tray; seam side down. Gather up the dough remnants and roll out again. Place one can with the dough wrapped around it upright onto the dough and use a small knife to cut out rounds. Repeat to make 2 rounds. These will be the lids. Place onto baking tray. Optional: Cut a small square and place in the centre of the lids. (I forgot to do this and had to stick on a cooked piece of gingerbread!) Place baking tray in the fridge with the cans on their side for 30 minutes. This helps stop the mason jars from sliding down when baking. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Put the oven shelf in the middle of your oven (note 5). Remove the baking tray from the fridge. If the dough on the cans has sagged slightly; use your hands to press it against the can. Turn the cans upright on the baking tray and place the tray into the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes; until golden brown; turning the tray halfway through (so the mason jar bakes an even colour). Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Once cool; gently pull the can and baking paper out of the Mason Jar. It should slip out fairly easily; if not; just twist it slightly to loosen then pull out. Fit the small circles into the base of the Mason Jar. It might need trimming to fit - be careful not to over trim; you want it to fit snugly. You do not need anything to make it stay in place because the gingerbread is sticky and the base should fit snugly. Decorating is optional. With a ribbon; I don't think any decorations are required. On one; I piped Royal Icing along the bottom; top and rim with Silver Sugar Balls. Use a mixer to beat the egg white until soft peaks form. Gradually add icing sugar; a heaped dessert spoon at a time; making sure it is incorporated before adding the next tablespoon. Transfer the Royal Icing into a piping bag with tip of choice. Use to decorate the Boxes and Mason Jar; as desired. Fill with homemade (or bought) treats of choice. Mine are pictured filled with homemade Chocolate Ganache Truffles. Tie with ribbons to make them pretty!
https://www.recipetineats.com/potted-trout-le-posh-on-le-budget/, Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted; then pour 2/3 into a bowl and set aside. Add the shallot; garlic and lemon rind to the pan and let it cook gently for 3 to 5 minutes until soft and translucent (it should not brown). You will only need to stir it occasionally. Meanwhile; remove the skin off the trout and discard. Use your hands to remove the flesh and place into a bowl; being careful to avoid the bones (you will be able to pull the flesh off the bones easily). Use a fork to flake the flesh. Discard the bones. Pour the shallot butter mixture into the bowl with the trout. Add lemon juice; cayenne pepper; creme fraiche; cream and herbs. Stir gently until well combined. Do a taste test and add salt and pepper if required. You may not need salt as smoked trout is often salty (I only add a tiny pinch). Spoon into jars or ramekins (1 large; 2 medium or 4 small) and smooth the surface. Pour over the reserved butter until the top is covered. Place in the refrigerator to set. (Note: Original recipe set to freeze it for 5 - 10 minutes first but I found that this caused the surface of the butter to crack). This can be served on the day you make it; but it gets even better with time. It can be made up to a week in advance. Serve with fresh or toasted bread.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mini-apple-pie-wonton-cups/, Preheat oven to 390F/200C. Mould wonton wrappers into standard size muffin tin / cupcake trays. Spray lightly with oil (this helps them bake evenly golden) then bake for 10 to 15 minutes until crisp and golden. Remove from oven and let cool in the muffin tins. Meanwhile; place Apple Pie Filling ingredients in a large saucepan over high heat. Bring to simmer; then turn the heat down to medium. Let simmer; stirring occasionally; until the apple is softened; around 8 minutes. There should be no liquid left; just a syrupy coating on the apple. Adjust sweetness to taste. The amount of sugar required differs depending on the tartness/sweetness of the apples. Remove from heat and let cool until it is warm. Meanwhile; whip cream and powdered sugar (icing sugar) until soft peaks form. To serve; spoon still warm Apple Pie Filling into wonton cups and top with a dollop of cream. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-zucchini-pancake-bites/, Use a cheese grater and grate the zucchini straight into a medium size bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix until just combined. Don't mix too much; just until it is just combined because otherwise you will overwork the flour and the pancake will be tough and hard. The batter will be quite thick; thicker than you expect. It will thin out in the next step. Set aside for 15 minutes. During this time the zucchini will sweat water. Give the batter a quick stir to mix the water in. While the batter is set aside; combine the Dipping Sauce ingredients in a small bowl then set aside. Heat oil in a large heavy based fry pan over medium high heat. Scoop up 1/2 cup (levelled) of batter and place in the pan. Use the bottom of the cup measure (or a spoon) to pat/spread the batter to make a circle that is roughly 12cm / 5 inches in diameter. Repeat with remaining batter (or cook in batches of 2 if your fry pan is not large enough). Cook each side for 1 1/2 minutes until golden brown. Serve immediately; scattered with extra shallots/scallions with the dipping sauce on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/shredded-red-cabbage-carrot-mint-salad/, Combine Salad ingredients in a bowl. Add Dressing ingredients; then toss to combine.
https://www.recipetineats.com/smoked-salmon-potato-rosti-stack/, Microwave the potatoes (unpeeled; whole) for 1 1/2 minutes on high; turn then microwave for a further 2 minutes. Or boil the potatoes for 5 minutes. The potatoes should be uncooked in the middle. Use a dishcloth to hold the potatoes and peel the skin off. I find it easiest to do this with a butter knife. Use a cheese grater and grate the potato. Add butter; salt and pepper and mix to combine. Heat olive oil in a large fry pan over medium high heat. Scoop up 1/4 cup of potato mixture and use an egg flip to lightly pack the potato into the measuring cup. Then place into the pan and lightly pat down with an egg flip to make the rosti about 1 cm / 1/3" thick. Repeat with remaining mixture. Cook until each side is golden brown - around 1 1/2 - 2 minutes for each side. Remove from fry pan. To serve; stack 3 rostis on each plate; top with smoked salmon; a dollop of sour cream and dill.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sirloin-steak-pesto-bell-peppers-flatbread/, Preferably bring your steak to room temperature. This will take 30 minutes if the air temperature is warm/hot; or an hour if it's cool. Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Do this just before you cook it. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy based fry pan over high heat until it starts to smoke. Place steaks in the fry pan. Cook each side for 2 minutes for medium rare. See notes for cooking times. Remove steaks from the fry pan onto a plate and cover loosely (not tightly) with foil. Allow to rest for 5 minutes; up to 10 minutes. While the steak is resting; return the fry pan to the stove over medium high heat with 1 tbsp oil. Add the bell pepper (capsicum) and cook; stirring occasionally; until nicely charred. Remove from heat. Serve the steaks topped with the bell pepper and with Pesto and Flatbread on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mini-pizza-potato-skins/, Preheat oven to 220C/430F. Prick each potato 2 to 3 times with a fork. Spread them out evenly around the edge of the microwave turntable (or in a circle for microwaves without a turntable). Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Turn potatoes over then microwave for a further 2 minutes; or until just cooked. Remove from microwave. Cut each potato in half; then use a teaspoon to scoop the filling out; leaving a thin layer of potato. Place the potatoes on a baking tray; skin side up. Brush with olive oil (or spray) then sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Bake skins for 10 minutes or until the skin is browned and a bit crispy. Turn the grill (broiler) on. Flip the potato skins over so the bowl side is facing up. Fill each potato skin with about 1 1/2 tsp of pizza sauce; then top with grated cheese. Place 2 to 3 pepperoni's on each; then place under the grill (broiler) for 3 to 5 minutes until the cheese is melted and the pepperoni is just starting to brown. Sprinkle with parsley; if using; and serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fluffy-coconut-rice/, Rinse rice in water until the water runs pretty clear. (Note 1)  Soak & drain – Drain rice then soak in water for 1 hour. Then drain in a colander and leave to drain well for 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F (180°C fan). Rice in pan – Place the rice in a 20cm / 8" square pan (metal or ceramic). Add pandam or kaffir; if using. Heat coconut milk – Heat coconut milk; water; sugar and salt in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and stir to dissolve the sugar.  Bake 40 minutes – Working quickly (to minimise heat loss); pour hot liquid over rice; stir quickly to spread rice evenly. Cover with foil then bake in the oven for 40 minutes. Rest 15 minutes – Remove the pan from the oven. Take a quick peek to ensure the liquid has been absorbed (tilt pan to check). There will be coconut cream on the surface – that's normal. Rest rice; covered; for 15 minutes. Do not shortcut this! Fluff with rubber spatula. Garnish with toasted coconut; if using; then serve. Marvel at fluffy rice! Combine all ingredients in a saucepan over high heat. Place lid on. When it comes to the boil (watch it; you don’t want it to boil over); turn down the heat to low / medium low so it is simmering gently. Leave it to simmer for 12 to 15 minutes until all the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat and rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff with fork. Garnish with toasted coconut; if using; then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/meatloaf-cupcakes-mashed-potato/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Spray 8 holes of a muffin tin. Grate the onion and carrot straight into a large bowl. Add remaining meatloaf ingredients and use your hands to mix and combine well. Scoop up 1/2 cup of mince and use your hands to form a rough ball shape. Press into the muffin tin. The surface should be a slight dome shape. Repeat with remaining mince. It should make about 8. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes until browned on top. Remove from oven. Peel and dice the potato. Steam or boil until soft but not waterlogged. Drain; then add butter and 1/2 cup of milk. Mash using a potato masher until smooth or to your liking. Add extra milk if you need it. The mash needs to be creamy but stiff enough to hold its shape when piped or piled onto the Meatloaf Cupcakes. Smear a dollop of tomato ketchup on the Meatloaf Cupcakes. Top with mashed potato; either by piping it or just dolloping it on with a spoon. Serve with a sprinkle of parsley; if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/bacon-french-toast-roll-ups/, Cut crusts off the bread. Use a rolling pin and roll back and forth 3 or 4 times on each piece of bread to flatten it out. Because it is fresh bread; it should become a bit sticky. Combine egg; milk and salt in a dish or bowl that is large enough for a roll up to lie flat in (so you can roll it in the egg mixture). Whisk with a fork to combine. Heat large pan over high heat (no oil required because the bacon is so fatty). Place bacon in the pan and sear each side until browned but not until it is crispy. If it is too crispy; it will just crumble when rolled up. Place one piece of bacon in the middle of each piece of bread. Roll up the bread; ending with the seam side down. Press down lightly to help it stay in place. Wipe pan clean; place butter in pan and return pan to heat. Roll a roll up in the egg mixture; then shake off excess. Enclose your fist around it (lightly) and twist the roll up a few times back and forth. This rubs the egg mixture into the roll up and helps ensure the seam remains sealed. Repeat with remaining roll ups. Place roll ups in the pan. Cook; rotating; for around 3 to 4 minutes until all sides are golden brown. Remove and serve immediately; with warmed Nachos Cheese Dip (if using).
https://www.recipetineats.com/pea-zucchini-pesto-orzo-risoni/, Place about 8 cups of water in a large saucepan and bring to boil. Add risoni and cook for 4 minutes; then add peas and cook for a further 1 minute. Note: The risoni will be slightly underdone at this point. It will finish cooking in the remaining steps. Scoop out 1/2 cup of the water from the saucepan; then drain the risoni and set aside until ready to add to the pan. Heat olive oil in a fry pan over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion and sauté for 1 minute until starting to soften. Add zucchini and sauté for a further 2 - 3 minutes until both the zucchini and onion are softened and the onion is starting to turn a light golden brown. Add pesto; risoni; pasta water reserved in step 3; salt and pepper. Bring the water to a simmer and stir for 1 minute until the water is absorbed. Serve immediately; garnished with freshly grated parmesan.
https://www.recipetineats.com/peanut-butter-chocolate-molten-lava-cake/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (convection/fan forced). Place chocolate and butter in a bowl. Microwave in 30 second bursts; stirring in between. Stir well to combine butter and chocolate and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile; generously grease 5 x 3/4 cup dariole moulds then dust with cocoa powder. (See notes 2 and 3) In a separate bowl; whisk together the eggs (2 x whole eggs + 2 x yolks) and sugar. Add the chocolate mixture and mix until combined. Add flour and fold through until just combined. Do not over mix. Pour batter into dariole moulds until it reaches halfway. Drop a heaped teaspoon of peanut butter in the centre of each. Push down gently to mostly submerge. Top up with remaining batter until the dariole mould is 3/4 filled. Do not overfill! (Note 4) Bake for 16 minutes; or until the top springs back when touched gently. (Note 5) Turn out onto plate. If you dusted the mould with cocoa powder; it should slip out easily. If it does not; then run a knife around the edge. Serve immediately!
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-crispy-chinese-shredded-chicken/, Place all ingredients except the oil in slow cooker. Slow cook on low for 8 hours. Place all ingredients except the oil in a pot in which the chicken fits quite snugly but not tightly (you don't want the sides of the chicken pressed up tightly against the wall of the pot). Put lid on and bring to boil over high heat. Turn heat down to low and let it simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours; until the meat is very tender and falling off the bone. Remove chicken from braising liquid. Shred with your hands or two forks; including the skin. The meat should fall off very easily. Heat 1 tbsp of oil over high heat in a large heavy based fry pan. Add chicken (enough to cover the pan without crowding it) and drizzle over braising liquid. Cook until the underside is browned and crispy (about 1 1/2 minutes); then remove from the pan. Don't flip the chicken (see notes). Repeat with remaining chicken (it takes me 3 batches). Serve with rice; on rice stick noodles or on a salad with the remaining braising liquid on the side. It is also great in fried rice. This freezes really well; before or after browning the chicken. Just divide into freezer bags; label then freeze. If you froze it before browning the chicken; then brown it after thawing.
https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-shredded-chicken-noodle-stir-fry/, Cook / soak rice stick noodles according to packet instructions. Drain and set aside. Heat oil in wok or large fry pan over high heat. Add garlic and stir fry for 30 seconds to flavour the oil. Remove and discard garlic. Add the Chinese broccoli stems and Shredded Chicken and stir fry for 1 1/2 minutes. Add the noodles; braising liquid and Sriracaha (if using) and stir fry; tossing the noodles rapidly to coat with the sauce for about 1 minute. The sugar in the braising liquid should make the noodles char a bit. Add the Chinese broccoli leaves and toss to mix in with the noodles; then remove from heat. The Chinese broccoli leaves will continue to cook from the residual heat. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/hot-mushroom-pepperoni-pizza-dip/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Heat a non stick fry pan over high heat. Add the diced pepperoni and fry for 1 minute until it starts to brown. Then add the onions and sauté for 1 minute. Then add the mushrooms and cook for 30 seconds. Remove onion mixture from the fry pan and place onto a plate with a paper towel (to drain the excess fat). Combine the Base ingredients in a bowl and mix until smooth and combined. Spread the Base in a 20 cm / 8 inch base with a 24 cm / 9 inch rim pie dish. Spread the pizza sauce over the Base; then sprinkle with the onion mixture. Sprinkle over the tasty cheese; then the mozzarella cheese. Place sliced pepperoni over the cheese. Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes; until golden brown and bubbling. Check it at 15 minutes. Serve immediately with Garlic Toast. Spread french stick slices on 2 baking trays (or one very large one). Bake for 5 to 8 minutes until crispy and lightly browned. Remove from oven and rub each piece lightly with the cut side of the garlic.
https://www.recipetineats.com/sunday-sunshine-eggs-in-mushroom/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Remove stalk from mushroom. Optional - scrape gills out with a teaspoon (the brown part). I usually only do this if the mushroom is on the small side and I need to make more room for the egg to fit. Divide the pasta sauce between the mushrooms and spread. Crack an egg into each mushroom. Pour cream over the eggs; drizzling to try to cover the whole surface. Place mushrooms in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle over the cheese; then return to oven. Bake for a further 5 minutes or until the egg whites are just set and (hopefully) the yolks are still runny (see note 3 for cooking time guidance). Remember that the eggs will continue to cook after you take them out of the oven. Garnish with parsley; if using; then serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/panko-herb-stuffed-mushrooms/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Break the stalks off the mushrooms; being careful to keep the caps in one piece. Pile the caps into a baking dish or tray. Drizzle over 1 tbsp olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the mushrooms out on the tray; cup side up. Finely chop the stalks. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a fry pan over medium high heat. Add the mushroom stalks and garlic and sauté for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until softened. Add the panko bread crumbs and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes until it becomes a light golden colour. Remove pan from heat and toss through salt; pepper; parsley and thyme leaves. Use a teaspoon to spoon panko filling into each mushroom cup. Don't worry about spillage! Just pile the filling into each cup as well as you can. Drizzle over remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil and bake for approximately 10 minutes; or until the mushrooms are softened (but not soft. They will go soggy and lose their shape). Serve warm or at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/fish-piccata-crispy-smashed-potatoes-15-minute-meal/, Cook the potatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes; turn potatoes; then cook for another 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. You will be able to tell by squeezing them if they are ready. Don't worry if the skin bursts; you are smashing them anyway. Use the side of a knife; meat mallet or your hand (covered with a dish cloth) and smash each potato so they are flattened to around 1.5cm/ 0.5" thick with a flattish surface. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Meanwhile; combine flour; salt and pepper on a plate and dredge each side of the fish in the flour mixture. Shake off excess flour. Heat olive oil in a non stick pan over high heat. Place fish and potatoes in the pan. Press the potatoes down lightly with a spatula to help it crisp up. Cook the first side of both the fish and potatoes for around 2 minutes until golden brown; then turn. Make sure the potato is crispy and brown. Cook the other side of the fish for 1 1/2 minutes (also see notes for fish cooking time). Then remove from the pan onto a plate and cover loosely with foil. Give the potatoes another 30 seconds to 1 minute to make it nice and brown and crispy; then remove from the pan. Turn heat down to medium high. Add wine and water to the pan. Scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan and mix it in. When the liquid comes to a rapid simmer; add the beans. Shake the pan occasionally to help the beans cook evenly. Cook the beans in the liquid for around 1 1/2 minutes until "tender crisp" (i.e. cooked but still crisp) and remove from pan. If the liquid reduces too much while cooking the beans (which might be the case if you are using a very large heavy based pan); just add a splash of water. Remove pan from heat. By the time you remove the beans; there should just be a bit of sauce left at the bottom of the fry pan; not even covering the entire base of the fry pan. Add lemon juice then stir through butter and capers. Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Place half the beans on each plate and place 3 potatoes on top. Top with a piece of fish. Spoon over the Sauce onto each fish and scatter with parsley. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/nachos-cheese-dip-sauce/, Toss the cheese and cornstarch together in a saucepan. Add all other ingredients; cook over medium heat; whisking often until the cheese is melted and smooth. Adjust to your taste if required – with extra hot sauce and salt. While hot; it will have a sauce like consistency – perfect for pouring over nachos. As it cools; it will thicken and become a dip-like consistency. Whisk occasionally to mix in the skin that forms on the top. Stir in additional evaporated (or even normal) milk to achieve the desired consistency if you want to use it as a pourable sauce. Note that when you reheat it; it loosens up.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-green-vegetable-pilaf-one-pot-dinner/, Heat olive oil in a large pot (preferably non stick) over medium high heat. Add the garlic and onion and sauté until the onion is softened and starting to brown - about 2 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat the grains with the oil; then add chicken stock. Bring to simmer then turn down heat to medium low. Place chicken on top of the rice (partially submerged); then cover pot and cook for 5 minutes. Remove lid and add peas and zucchinis (don't stir; just scatter them across the top); then cover and cook for a further 5 to 8 minutes until most of the water has been absorbed and the rice is just slightly undercooked. It might take longer if you are using a smaller pot. Remove the chicken and set aside to rest for a few minutes. Scatter the asparagus over the top; then place the lid back on and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until rice is al dente (cooked but still firm to touch); then remove the pot from the stove and let stand for 5 minutes. Shred the chicken with a fork (or your fingers; if cool enough); then add back into the pot with the resting rice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Squeeze juice of the lemon over the rice. Gently stir the rice to fluff it up and toss the ingredients through. Spoon onto serving plates; scatter with feta and parsley (if using); and lemon wedges on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/syrian-chicken-giant-couscous/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place chicken on a plate or in a large bowl. Sprinkle with Chicken Spices and use your hands to coat the chicken. Heat olive oil in a large; oven proof fry pan over high heat.

Nestle the chicken into the tomato broth; then cover with foil (or lid) and place into the oven. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile; cook the Giant Couscous according to packet instructions. Usually it just needs to be boiled in salted water for around 4 minutes; then drain it. When the chicken is dark golden brown and cooked; remove from oven. Stir through dried currents (if using); lemon juice and half the mint and coriander. Then sprinkle over remaining mint and coriander. Serve on Giant Couscous with a dollop of yoghurt; if using.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chili-con-carne-corn-bread-pie/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Place 1 cup of Shredded Beef Chili Con Carne into 4 individual pie dishes; or 1 large pie dish. Combine Corn Bread Topping dry ingredients in a bowl and given them a quick stir to combine. Add Corn Bread Topping wet ingredients and mix to combine until lump free. Pour corn bread mixture over filling so it is about 1.5 cm / 1/2" thick. Place pie in the oven and bake for 20 to 30 minutes until golden brown on top. If making one large one; it will take closer to 35 minutes. To test for doneness; insert a skewer in the middle of the corn bread and make sure it comes out clean. If there is batter on the skewer; return to oven. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving; garnished with fresh parsley.
https://www.recipetineats.com/rocket-aragula-beetroot-walnuts-feta-wbalsamic-dressing/, Combine the Dressing ingredients in a jar; and shake well. You might need a spoon to break up the honey to mix it in properly. Adjust salt to your taste. Place rocket lettuce in a serving bowl. Scatter over beetroot. No need to toss - because of the weight; it should disperse throughout fairly well. Crumble over the feta and scatter with walnuts. Drizzle over dressing and serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/ham-cheese-french-toastie-roll-ups/, Optional - cut the crusts off the bread. Use a rolling pin to flatten the bread. Divide the ham between the bread and lay it out in a strip about 1cm / 1/3" wide along the bottom edge of the bread. Cut to fit neatly if necessary - that's what I did. Top each with 2 slices of cheese; or scatter grated cheese along the ham. Starting from the bottom; roll the bread up and finish with the seam side down. Place the egg; milk and salt in a flat dish and use a fork to whisk. Heat butter in a large fry pan over medium high heat. Dip the roll ups in the egg; rolling to coat all over.

https://www.recipetineats.com/broccoli-fritters/, Steam or boil the broccoli until quite tender (but not mushy). I did this in the microwave using a steamer; it took 3 minutes on high. Use a potato masher to roughy "squish" the broccoli. Not to look like mashed potato; but just to squish it a bit so when cooked it can be flattened with a spatula to make fritters with a smooth surface rather than having big lumps sticking out. Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients and mix well. Place egg in a bowl and use a fork to lightly beat the egg. Add the remaining Batter ingredients and mix until combined. The Batter may seem a little thick but it will loosen up when you add the broccoli because when you squish it; it will release some liquid. Add the broccoli and mix to evenly disperse throughout the Batter. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a fry pan over medium heat. Scoop 1/4 cup of Batter and drop into the pan and use a spoon to gently flatten to about 1cm/1/3" thickness. Cook 3 fritters at a time. Cook each side for 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown.

Divide into two freezer bags - about 1 1/2 cups per bag. You will only use one bag for the meal. Then place in ziplock bag or container and put it in the freezer. If you want to go the extra step; you could also cut and measure out the carrots; peas and corn and put them in a freezer bag too. I tend not to bother because this does not take long to do and also; you need to cut the onion fresh anyway. Remove chicken and rice from the freezer and allow to defrost. Cut the stems off the leaves of the bok choy. Cut the stems vertically into 1cm/1/3" thick sticks. Heat wok or fry pan over high heat. Add sesame seeds and toast for 15 seconds; then remove.

You can store the cooked pork in the fridge for up to 3 days. Brown the Pork Carnitas: Heat 1/2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan. Add half the Pork Carnitas and press down lightly with a spatula to help them brown evenly. Once the underside is brown and crispy; remove from the pan and set aside (about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes). Do not flip - only one side should be crispy (see notes). Repeat with remaining Pork Carnitas. Make the Enchilada Sauce as per the recipe. Make the caramelised onion (for the Quesadillas and Pork Rolls) at the same time you are making the Enchilada Sauce (both are fairly low maintenance).

Mix to combine. Spread 1 tbsp of enchilada sauce on the base of a baking dish. Line the baking dish with tortillas. I find the best way to do this is to cut the tortillas in half; place 2 on the baking dish (with the straight cut side lined to the edge of the baking dish); then cut 1 tortilla into 6 to 8 pieces and use those wedges to fill the gaps. Spread half the filling across the tortillas. Top with another layer of tortillas; then spread the remaining filling on top. Top with a third and final layer of tortillas.

Whisk until lump free. Heat butter in non stick pan (25cm/10" diameter) over medium high heat. Use an egg flip to spread the butter all over the pan. Use a paper towel to wipe the butter of the pan thoroughly. Pour half the batter in the pan and swirl around to evenly cover the base of the pan. Cook until lots of bubbles appear on the surface. Lift up the edge and peer underneath - if it is golden; it is ready to flip. About 2 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook the other side for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. The other side will not take as long to cook. Remove from pan and repeat with remaining batter. You will not need to put butter in the pan again. To serve (optional) - top with slices of strawberries and a sprinkling of icing sugar with golden syrup on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/zucchini-gratin-unintentionally-healthy/, Grate the zucchini and place in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 2 tsp salt and use your hands to mix through well. Place zucchini in a colander over a bowl to collect the juices that sweat out. Leave for at least 20 minutes. Squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini; straining the liquid through the colander to add to the zucchini juices collected. Rinse the zucchini under cold water for 15 seconds; then squeeze out excess water; but this time do not save the water that is squeezed out. Pat the zucchini with paper towels to mostly dry. Top up the zucchini juices with milk to make a total of 2 1/2 cups of liquid. Warm liquid in microwave or on the stove. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large heavy base pan over medium heat. Add garlic and onion and sauté for 8 minutes until translucent and starting to turn golden. Turn heat up to medium high; add the zucchini and cook for 5 minutes; stirring frequently. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes; stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add all but 2 tbsp of the parmesan cheese and stir quickly to combine. Do a taste test to check for seasoning. Add more salt if desired; and a good grind of black pepper. I do not add more salt as I don't think it is required. Add rice and liquid. If making ahead; stop here; then proceed with the next step on the day of serving. Preheat oven to 220C/425F Return pan to heat and bring to simmer. If the pan you are using is not ovenproof; pour the contents into a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle over the remaining 2 tbsp of parmesan cheese and drizzle over the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. Cover with lid or foil; then place in the top 1/3 of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes; then remove the lid/foil and bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes until the top is golden and the liquid appears to have been absorbed. (Tilt the dish slightly. If liquid pools then return to the oven for 5 minutes at a time.) Rest for 10 minutes. While resting; any residual liquid will be absorbed. Best served immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-cheek-ragu-pasta-cook-eat-thrice/, Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook for 6 minutes or until just before al dente (i.e. slightly undercooked; very firm to touch). The pasta will be cooked more in the pasta sauce. Meanwhile; heat olive oil in large pan over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté for 3 minutes. Add remaining ingredients. Bring to rapid simmer; stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If the sauce seems too thick; add a splash of the pasta cooking water. Use tongs and transfer the pasta straight from the pot of boiling water into the pan with the ragu sauce. Add 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water and gently toss the pasta in the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes. The pasta is ready when the spaghetti is al dente (cooked but slightly firm to touch) and the sauce has thickened and is tossed through the pasta. Serve immediately; sprinkled with freshly grated parmesan cheese and parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/beef-mushroom-vegetable-pie/, Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. You will need 4 x 1 2/3 cup capacity ramekins. Place 1 ramekin on the puff pastry and use it as a guide to cut rounds out of the puff pastry. Cut 4 rounds. Heat oil in large heavy based pan over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic; and sauté for 2 minutes. Add carrots and sauté for 1 minute. Then add mushrooms and sauté for another minute. Add remaining Pie Filling ingredients. Let simmer for 3 minutes to bring the flavours together. Divide the Pie Filling between the 4 ramekins. Top with puff pastry rounds and cut a small slash in each (steam vents). Brush with egg; then place into the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the pastry is dark golden and puffed. Remove from oven; let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/hummus-lamb/, Place a pan over medium high heat. Add pine nuts and toast until golden. Remove pine nuts from pan and set aside. Return pan to stove (still on medium high heat) and add olive oil. Add onion and cook until translucent (2 minutes). Then turn up the heat to high; add mince; spices and salt. Cook; breaking up the mince into small pieces; until browned and cooked through (3 minutes). Set aside and cover so it doesn't dry out. Bring it to room temperature. Place all ingredients except salt in a food processor or blender and process until smooth. Taste before adding salt and pepper. Different brands of chick peas have different levels of saltiness. Also adjust acidity with lemon juice; if required. Use water to adjust the consistency to a tomato sauce (ketchup) like consistency. This consistency is "proper" hummus. In the Middle East; hummus is not the thick consistency that is typical of store bought hummus in Western countries; it is thinner. Spread hummus on a plate; using the back of a spoon to create "swirls". Top with lamb mince; scatter over the pine nuts and sprinkle with parsley. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with pita bread.
https://www.recipetineats.com/middle-eastern-lamb-lentil-rice-pilaf/, Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until golden and translucent. Turn up heat to high and add lamb. Use spatula to break mince up and cook until browned. Add Spice Mix and cook for 30 seconds until spices are fragrant and mixed through the mince. If using silverbeet/chard; add half the silverbeet into the pan and sauté for 15 seconds until starting to wilt. (If using spinach; do not add any at this stage). Add rice; water and lentils and stir. Bring to simmer; then put lid on and turn down heat to medium low. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes until water is absorbed. Remove pot from heat; take lid off and quickly spread the remaining silverbeet or all the spinach on top of the rice; then put the lid back on. Rest rice for 10 minutes. Remove lid; stir through silverbeet/spinach and fluff up the rice. Spoon rice into serving dish; top with Fried Asian Shallots and parsley if desired. Serve the sliced tomatoes on the side.
https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-spinach-bread-bake-strata/, Defrost the spinach in the microwave (4 minutes on high); then squeeze out excess water. Make Egg mixture: Place ingredients into a bowl and whisk until combined. Spread half the bread into the base of a baking dish 25cm x 25cm (10" x 10"). Layer with the spinach; then chicken then top with half the cheese. Top with remaining bread. Squish the bread down to compress (this helps the egg mixture to be soaked up evenly). Pour over egg mixture - try to cover all the bread evenly. Top with remaining cheese; then squish down to help the bread soak up the egg mixture. Set aside for at least 15 minutes; preferably 30 minutes. To freeze: Cover tightly and place in freezer. Defrost completely before cooking. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Cover baking dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil; then bake for a further 10 minutes until golden on top. Serve immediately; sprinkled with parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/quiche-toast-cups/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Heat 1 tsp oil in small pan over high heat. Add onion and bacon and sauté until bacon is crisp - about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside (you can just leave it in the pan). Cut bread into rounds or just cut crusts off. I use a 800g/28oz tomato can (emptied and washed) - the perfect size to cut rounds to fit into muffin tins out of bread; pastry etc. Use a rolling pin to flatten the bread. Lightly spray 6 muffin tin holes with oil spray; then press the bread into the muffin tin. Place in oven for 3 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. The toast cups should not be browned; just a bit dry (like "toast"). Whisk together the egg; milk; parsley and a pinch of salt and pepper. Divide the bacon mixture between the 6 toast cups; then the cheese. Pour 2 1/2 tbsp of egg mixture into each cup; then immediately place in the oven. If you take too long between pouring the egg mixture into the toast cups and putting it in the oven; the egg will start soaking into the bread. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the top is lightly golden and the filling is set. Remove from oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving. The filling will be puffed up but it will deflate while resting. Garnish with extra parsley if desired. Serve warm.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-pork-cutlet/, Place the Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag and massage the bag to mix the ingredients. Add pork to the Marinade and massage the bag to coat all the cutlets with the Marinade. Marinate for at least 4 hours; up to 24 hours. Brush the outdoor grill with oil and heat to medium high (or pan on a stove). Remove pork from the marinade. Place pork on the grill and cook each side for 2 minutes; or until cooked (depends on thickness of the cutlets). Remember that it will continue to cook while resting. Remove pork from the grill onto a plate and cover loosely with foil. Rest for 5 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-marinara-sauce/, Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker. Set for 6 to 8 hours on low. Optional step: Remove bay leaves; then use a handheld blender to puree until smooth (or to your liking). Cool before refrigerating or freezing. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add pasta. Heat olive oil in a pan; add garlic and diced onion; cook until translucent then add 2 cups of Marinara Sauce per 500g/1lb of dried pasta. Bring sauce to rapid simmer; then add pasta (cooked to just before al dente). Add 1/4 cup of pasta water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until pasta is al dente and the sauce has thickened and coats the pasta. Serves 4 hungry people or 6 normal servings.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-arancini-balls/, Combine risotto with the egg and cheese and mix well. Do a test ball to determine stiffness of risotto (optional step - see note 2): Take a slightly mounded scoop of the risotto using an ice cream scooper (about 1/4 cup); roll it into an egg shape and place it upright on a small plate so that it is higher than it is wide. Wait a minute or two and see if it holds its shape. If it collapses at bit; use the plain breadcrumbs to thicken the risotto - you may not need any; you might need more or less. Do another test until you are happy with the consistency. Cover risotto and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Lightly grease or spray a baking tray. Combine panko and salt in a bowl. Then add the olive oil and use your fingers to lightly "rub" the olive oil into the panko and disperse it as evenly as possible Make the arancini balls: As per the test ball; make arancini balls using the ice-cream scooper. Drop the balls into the bowl with the panko. Spoon over the panko; then use your fingers to either roll and pat the panko so it sticks to the arancini. Scoop the arancini out of the panko bowl using a dessert spoon and use your fingers to shape it into an egg / cylinder shape. Place the arancini onto the baking tray upright so it stands taller than it is wide. The reason for this is that the arancini will collapse a bit when baking. So by shaping them slightly taller; when they come out of the oven they will be more of a ball shape rather than collapsing into a pattie. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until golden. Remove from oven; rest for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with finely chopped parsley if desired.
https://www.recipetineats.com/jam-jelly-doughnut-french-toast/, Optional: Cut the bread into rounds; as large as you can. See notes for tip. Spread 1 tbsp of strawberry jam into the middle of 3 of the rounds; leaving an edge of about 1cm / 1/4" so when you put the sandwich together; the jam does not ooze out of the side. (See photo below) Put sandwich together. Place egg and milk in a small bowl and beat lightly. Spread sugar on a small plate. Heat butter in large non stick pan over medium high heat. Quickly dip each side of a sandwich into the egg mixture; then roll the edge in the egg mixture as well. Then place in the pan. Repeat with remaining sandwiches. Cook each side for around 2 minutes; until a deep golden brown. Remove from the pan and immediately place on the plate with the sugar to coat each side and the edges. The faster you get it from the pan into the sugar; the better the sugar will stick. Serve warm or at room temperature.
https://www.recipetineats.com/midweek-paella/, Cut chorizo into quarters vertically; then slice into 0.5cm / 1/3 inch pieces. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in pan over high heat. Add chicken and sear each side until golden brown; but not cooked through. It will finish cooking with the rice. Remove chicken from the pan onto a plate and set aside. Place garlic; onion and chorizo in pan. The chorizo will release oil so you don't need extra oil. Stir and cook for 1 minute until the chorizo starts to brown. Add capsicum; then stir and cook for 1 minute until chorizo is dark golden brown. Add rice and stir until coated with the oil. Add chicken stock; tinned tomato; spinach; half the peas and paprika. Stir gently to mix; bring to simmer then turn down heat to medium high so the stock remains at a gentle simmer. Place the chicken into the pan; mostly submerged. Cook; without stirring; for 10 minutes. Then scatter the remaining peas over the top and continuing cooking for a further 5 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked but it should still be slightly firm (al dente). Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Any residual liquid will be absorbed while it is resting. Scatter with parsley and serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pea-cabbage-parmesan-mint-salad/, Reserve 1 tbsp of the parmesan cheese as garnish. Place all ingredients in a bowl and toss gently to combine. Allow to sit for 5 minutes to allow the cabbage to wilt slightly. Adjust seasoning with extra salt and pepper (if required); garnish with reserved 1 tbsp parmesan cheese and serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-mexican-spring-rolls-egg-rolls/, Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Combine the filling ingredients and mix well. Place a wrapper diagonally in front of you. Place 1/4 cup of the filling on the bottom half of the wrapper and shape into a log. If you are using egg roll wrappers; use 3 tablespoons per wrapper. Roll up the wrapper to halfway; then fold in the left and right sides; then roll to the end; using a little water to seal. Spray the spring rolls lightly; then turn each spring roll and lightly spray the other side. Bake for 30 minutes; turning once; until golden. Serve with Enchilada Sauce as the dipping sauce.
https://www.recipetineats.com/herb-chilli-feta/, Infuse olive oil with garlic (optional): use the side of your knife to smash the garlic cloves and combine with the olive oil. Cover; refrigerate and leave for as long as possible - a few hours or preferably overnight. If you do not have the time to do Step 1; just mince 1 garlic clove (small) and stir into the olive oil. Cut the feta into bite size cubes - about 1cm / 1/3 inch. Place feta into serving dish; scatter over herbs; chilli; lemon rind and a grind of black pepper. Pour over olive oil. Serve with crusty bread.
https://www.recipetineats.com/giant-hash-brown/, Peel and grate the potatoes; placing the grated potato into a large bowl of water (this stops the potato from going brown while you continue grating). Using a large colander; rinse the potato until the water comes clear (to remove the starch which keeps the potato from going brown as well as making it crispy). Working a handful at a time; squeeze out the excess water and place into the bowl. Mix in 1 tbsp of olive oil; salt and pepper. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a 22cm/9 inch non stick pan over medium high heat. Place shredded potato mixture in pan; spread out and lightly pat down with a spatula. It should be about 1.5cm/0.6" thick. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Use a spatula to lift a corner to check for doneness. Get a large plate and slide the hash brown onto it. Place the pan on top of the plate; then quickly flip upside down. Use a tea towel if you need so you can hold onto the fry pan when flipping. Don't worry if it breaks when you flip it; it's salvageable! Drizzle the remaining 1 tbsp of oil around the edges of the fry pan. If your hash brown broke when you flipped it; use a spatula to lightly pat it back into shape. Cook until golden brown and crispy; about 4 to 6 minutes. Use a spatula to lift up to check. Slide out of the plan onto a serving plate. Season with additional salt if required. To serve; garnish with chopped parsley (optional) and cut into wedges.
https://www.recipetineats.com/taco-soup-pork-carnitas/, Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the pulled pork and cook for 1 minute until parts of it are browned; then remove from the saucepan. Do this step even if you are using shredded chicken or another meat. Add garlic and onion; sauté until onion becomes translucent (2 minutes); then add the capsicum (bell pepper) and cook for 1 minute until softened. Return the pulled pork into the saucepan and add all other ingredients except salt and pepper. If you are making this ahead to FREEZE; see below for instructions. Stir to scrap the brown bits from the pulled pork off the bottom of the pan to mix in with the soup flavours. Bring to boil then turn down heat slightly and allow to simmer rapidly for 3 minutes so the flavours can come together. If you are using crushed tinned tomatoes instead of passata; let it simmer for a further 5 minutes to let the tomatoes breakdown a bit. If the soup gets too thick to your liking; just add a bit more water. Do a taste test; then season with salt and pepper. It is important to season last because different stock brands have different levels of saltiness. Serve with toppings of choice. The more toppings = more delicious! Follow steps 1 to 3. In step 4; do not add the tomato passata or chicken/vegetable stock/broth. Instead; add 1 cup of water; bring to simmer and stir; scraping the bottom of the pot to get the brown bits off. Remove pot from heat and set aside to cool; then pour the contents into a container or ziplock bag and freeze. To cook; defrost; then pour the contents into a saucepan. Add the tomato passata and chicken stock/broth. Then follow steps 6 onwards as per above.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cinnamon-roasted-pumpkin-yoghurt-pinenuts-2/, Preheat oven to 200C/390F. Combine olive oil; cinnamon; salt and pepper in a shallow dish large enough to fit the pumpkin wedges. Even a plate will work; it just needs to be large enough to lay the pumpkin wedge flat. Place each side of the pumpkin wedge in the olive oil mixture; using your hands if needed to spread the cinnamon over each piece; including on the skin. Place pumpkin on baking tray and drizzle over any remaining olive oil. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the pumpkin is golden and cooked through (no need to turn). (See notes on cooking tips) When the pumpkin is cooked; remove from baking tray and place on serving platter. Drizzle over lemon juice. Rest for 5 to 10 minutes before garnishing. If you are making it ahead; let it come to room temperature before putting on the other garnishes. To serve; season with extra salt and pepper; drizzle over the yoghurt; scatter over pine nuts; coriander leaves and chilli.
https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-chicken-wings/, Bruise the lemongrass using the side of your knife (or a pestle). Slice the white part only into 0.5cm / 1/4" slices; thick enough to pick off later if any stick to the wings. Combine lemongrass with the rest of the marinade ingredients and mix well. Combine marinade with wings in a ziplock bag. Remove as much air as possible from the bag and seal. Massage marinade into the wings to evenly disperse. Marinate for at least a few hours; preferably overnight. When ready to cook; pour the wings and marinade into a large bowl. Lightly oil the grill and preheat on medium low. The grill side cooks the wings more evenly than the hotplate side. Remove wings from marinade and grill until cooked through. Do not cook on a high heat otherwise the sugar will burn before the inside of the wings are cooked. Just before the wings are ready; remove the wings from the grill and put them back into the bowl and toss in the marinade; then put back on the BBQ and sear quickly on both sides. Preheat oven to 180C/350F and put the rack in the top part of the oven. Line a baking tray with baking paper and place a rack on it. Remove wings from the marinade and spread out over the rack. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the top side is golden brown; then turn the wings and baste. Return to oven for another 10 to 15 minutes until the wings are a dark golden brown. Turn again; baste and return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Serve garnished with coriander leaves and chilli slices (optional).
https://www.recipetineats.com/packet-ramen-makeover/, Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix well until there are no cornflour lumps. Bring water to boil and cook ramen per packet instructions; using the soup stock packet that comes with the ramen. (See Notes) Heat oil in wok (or fry pan) over high heat. Add garlic and stir fry for 20 seconds until fragrant - be careful not to burn it. Add carrots and mushrooms and stir fry for 30 seconds; then Chinese cabbage and stir fry for another 30 seconds. Add sauce and cook for 30 seconds until it becomes thick and glossy. Remove from heat; immediately add the bean sprouts and give a quick stir to coat the bean sprouts in the sauce and use the residual heat to slightly cook the bean sprouts. Place noodles and soup in bowl; top with vegetables and garnish with shallots. Serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/momofuku-marinated-beef-skirt-steak-ssam/, Combine Beef with Marinade and marinade at least overnight; up to 24 hours. Remove beef from marinade. Preheat outdoor grill or heavy based skillet on stove on very high heat. You want it to be screaming hot. Cook the beef to your liking (see notes for guide). When done; remove from heat; cover loosely with foil and let them rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Make the Ginger Spring Onion Sauce by combining the ingredients and mixing to combine. Make the Ssam Sauce by combining the ingredients and mixing well until smooth. Slice the beef into 0.5cm / 0.2 inch thick slices; against the grain. Serve with lettuce; Ginger Spring Onion Sauce and Ssam Sauce on the side. To eat; place a piece of beef in a lettuce leaf; top with some of each sauce; then fold over lettuce; eat and be happy.
https://www.recipetineats.com/lemon-cannellini-bean-bruschetta/, Preheat a griddle pan or barbecue (grill side; not hotplate side) on high. Place bread on the barbecue or griddle pan; and cook each side until nicely toasted and golden brown with char lines. You can also toast the bread in a toaster or grill/broil. Remove from heat and rub the surface of the bread lightly with the garlic. Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Mash about half the beans with a fork - leave some of the beans whole for a bit of texture. Taste first before seasoning with salt and pepper (saltiness of beans depends on brand). Spread topping onto bread. Garnish with extra parsley; drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/trio-bruschetta-celery-lime-bruschetta/, Preheat a griddle pan or barbecue (grill side; not hotplate side) on high. Place bread on the barbecue or griddle pan; and cook each side until nicely toasted and golden brown with char lines. You can also toast the bread in a toaster or grill/broil. Remove from heat and rub the surface of the bread lightly with the garlic. Cut 5 1/2 of the celery sticks into chunks (about 4 cups) and place into food processor with remaining ingredients and whizz until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Dice the remaining 1/2 celery stick. Stir into the celery puree. Spread topping onto bread. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/smores-french-toast/, Combine egg and milk in a shallow dish large enough to lay the bread in. Spread Nutella on all 4 slices of bread. Generously! Place marshmallows on 2 of the pieces of bread; with the sticky side of the marshmallows (ie. the cut side) facing up. Heat butter in pan over medium high heat. (See notes) Take the bread with the marshmallows on them and quickly dip the bottom side of the bread (ie. the side without the Nutella and marshmallows on it) into the egg mixture; then place into the pan. Dip the remaining two slices of bread into the egg mixture (the side without Nutella on it) and place on top of the marshmallow topped bread in the pan; to form a sandwich (ie. The side with the Nutella on it should be placed onto the marshmallows and the side you dipped into the egg mixture should face up so when you flip; it will be cooked). Press down lightly with a spatula to help disperse the heat through to the centre of the sandwich to melt the marshmallows. Don't press too hard - I made that mistake once and most of my marshmallows oozed out the side into the pan. When the bottom is golden brown (about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes); flip and cook the other side until golden brown (about 2 minutes). Don't worry if the marshmallows aren't oozing out the side when you finish cooking; they will continue to melt from the heat in the sandwich. But they should be very soft - just touch one and you'll be able to tell if it's melted and gooey inside. Serve immediately; topped with extra marshmallows and chocolate sauce; if you wish.
https://www.recipetineats.com/pulled-pork-enchiladas/, Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a pan over high heat. Add the pork carnitas and cook until the bottom is nicely browned - about 1 1/2 minutes. Do not turn; just make the bottom crispy (to keep the pulled pork as moist as possible); then remove the pulled pork into a bowl. It does not matter if the top isn't heated through; it will heat in the oven. Add the corn; black beans; 1/2 cup enchilada sauce and 1/2 cup cheese into the bowl and mix to combine. Spread 1/2 cup of Enchilada Sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Place 1/2 packed cup of filling (from step 3) into a tortilla and roll up and place in the baking dish. Pour over the remaining Enchilada Sauce; and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter the cheese on; then bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
https://www.recipetineats.com/teriyaki-chicken/, Combine the 4 ingredients in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to boil; then turn heat down and simmer until it reduces by half - it should only take 5 minutes or so. The consistency should be like a light syrup. Keep your eye on it - it will start to thicken suddenly! Bring to room temperature before using. Combine the Marinade with the chicken and marinate for at least 20 minutes; preferably overnight. Remove chicken from Marinade but do not discard the Marinade liquid. Heat oil in non stick pan over medium to medium-high heat. You don't want it too hot because otherwise the sugar in the Marinade will burn before the inside is cooked. Place the chicken in the pan and cook the first side for around 3 minutes; checking to ensure the skin isn't cooking too quickly. If it is; remove pan from heat and turn the heat down; and add about 2 to 4 tbsp of water to the pan then return to the stovetop. The water slows down the searing process on the skin while still allowing the chicken to cook on the inside. Turn chicken over and cook the other side. Just before the chicken is finished cooking; add 2 tbsp of water to the pan and and swirl around and mix with the marinade that has come off the chicken. This will make a dark glossy "sauce". Move the chicken around in the pan to coat with this sauce. The Marinade is a strong flavour so you shouldn't need any extra sauce. But if you do want more; add equal parts of Teriyaki Sauce and water to the pan and allow to come to a simmer and let it cook until the desired consistency. Serve with rice.
https://www.recipetineats.com/homemade-teriyaki-sauce/, Combine ingredients in a large saucepan over high heat. The larger the pan; the faster it will reduce. For me it takes about 10 minutes; but it depends on the size of the pan you use. Bring to boil; then turn heat down and simmer until it reduces by half. The consistency should be like a light syrup. Bring to room temperature before using. Combine 3 to 4tbsp of Marinade per 1lb/500g of meat and marinate for at least 20 minutes; preferably overnight. However; if marinating fish; do not marinate for more than a few hours at most - 20 minutes is enough (otherwise the flavour will overpower the fish). Teriyaki goes very well with chicken; beef and fish that suit strong flavours such as salmon. You can grill/broil; pan fry or BBQ/grill the meat. If you are cooking it on the BBQ/grill or broiling/grilling the meat; then baste each side at least once during cooking. If you are cooking this on the stove then just before the meat has finished cooking; add 2 tbsp of water to the pan and swirl it around to mix with the marinade that has come off the meat. Bring it to a rapid simmer and cook until it becomes a thick sauce consistency; and move the meat around in the sauce to coat it.
https://www.recipetineats.com/mexican-fried-rice/, Combine the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix. Heat the oil in a pan over high heat. Add garlic and cook for 10 seconds until fragrant. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook until the onion becomes translucent - about 2 minutes. If you are using uncooked protein; add it and sauté until just cooked through. Add the black beans and corn. If you are using cooked proteins (like shredded cooked chicken) add it at the same time. Cook for 1 minute just to heat through. Add the rice and Sauce and stir quickly to coat the rice evenly. Check seasoning and add more salt if you require it. Amount of salt required depends on the saltiness of the enchilada sauce you are using. Season with black pepper and serve immediately.
https://www.recipetineats.com/japanese-salmon-mirin-soy-sauce/, Combine all ingredients except the oil in a ziplock bag; remove as much air as possible and marinade overnight (or minimum 3 hours). Heat 1/2 tbsp oil in a non stick pan over medium heat. Add salmon skin side down; cook for 2 to 3 minutes until crispy. Check the skin to ensure it isn't cooking too quickly - if it is; then turn down the heat and/or remove the pan from the stove briefly to allow the temperature to decrease. Drizzle over remaining marinade in the ziplock bag over the flesh side. Flip and cook the flesh side for 2 minutes; or to your liking. I like salmon medium rare so the inside is very moist and just cooked. Rest for a couple of minutes; remembering that the salmon will continue to cook while resting; then serve.
https://www.recipetineats.com/cinnamon-french-toast-sticks/, Remove crust of each slice; then cut each into 3 equal thick batons. Combine the eggs; milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl large enough to roll the bread sticks in. Combine the cinnamon and sugar on a plate. Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a large pan over medium high heat. Roll the sticks in the egg mixture quickly (do not soak them); shake off excess and place in pan. Cook in 2 batches. Turn to cook each side until golden. Immediately transfer to the plate with the cinnamon sugar and roll to coat.

https://www.recipetineats.com/fattoush-with-crunchy-flatbread-ribbons/, Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Roll up the flatbread then cut into thin slices. Use your fingers to loosen them into a pile of "ribbons". Pile onto a baking tray; drizzle over olive oil and a couple of pinches of salt; then use your fingers to coat all the ribbons with the oil. Bake in oven for 3 minutes; then remove tray and move the ribbons around a bit so they bake evenly. At this stage some of the ribbons will not yet be crisp. Turn the oven OFF; then return the tray into the oven for a couple of minutes. This will make all the ribbons crisp without over browning them. While the ribbons are baking; combine the red onion in a small bowl with 1 tbsp lemon juice and pinch of salt. Set aside - it lightly pickles and removes some of the acidity from the onion. Combine the dressing ingredients. Combine the tomatoes; cucumbers; mint and coriander leaves in a small bowl. Squeeze excess juice from the lemons; and add to the bowl. Pour over dressing and toss gently to combine - you may not need all the dressing. Transfer salad onto a platter then pile on the crunchy flatbread ribbons. Sprinkle with extra sumac.

Bring to boil; taste and adjust if necessary. Add chicken to soup; bring back to boil. Remove from heat and put aside covered for 20 - 25 mins. Don't worry if you leave it for longer; it won't over cook. When the chicken is poached; remove from the soup and slice into 1/4" / 0.5cm slices. Cook noodles according to the packet instructions - usually for fresh noodles soaking them in boiling water is sufficient.

Bring the soup (without the poached chicken in it) back to boil; add the bok choy stems; boil for 30 seconds then remove from heat; add the bok choy leaves and bean sprouts.

While the sauce is simmering away; whisk together the egg; milk; butter and salt into a bowl.

Submerge each bread into the mixture; then remove; allowing the excess egg to drip off. Don't soak the bread in the egg mixture; you don't want it to be completely soaked through; just coated. Place in pan and cook until golden brown on each side - about 1 1/2 minutes. To serve; place french toast on a plate and top with the apple mixture; spooning over the syrup.

https://www.recipetineats.com/twice-baked-make-ahead-cheese-souffle/, Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Grease four ramekins or 6 small ramekins very well (see notes for size). Bring kettle to boil with plenty of water. Melt half the butter (i.e. 2 tbsp) in a medium saucepan over medium heat; add the leek and cook for a couple of minutes until softened; then remove from pan into a bowl. In the same pan; melt the remaining butter; add the flour and stir for a couple of minutes. Then whisking constantly; add 1/4 of the milk; and when it has combined (it will be a thick paste consistency) add the remaining milk; whisking constantly over the medium heat. Continue to whisk and in a minute or two; it will start to thicken. Once it becomes the consistency of a thick pouring cream; remove from heat; add the cheese and leeks and mix to combine. The cheese does not need to melt. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly; then add the egg yolks; salt and pepper and mix to combine. Meanwhile; beat the egg whites until stiff then fold a spoonful of the whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it. Then pour the cheese mixture into the bowl with the egg whites and gently fold it to combine. Do NOT over mix as it will knock out the air out of the egg whites; it is mixed enough when there are still slight streaks of white and yellow. Spoon the mixture into ramekins and smooth the tops. Place in a baking dish then pour boiling water around the ramekins so that it comes half way up their sides. Bake in oven for about 20 minutes or until puffed up and golden on top. Remove from oven and leave in ramekins for a couple of minutes. Then run a small knife around the edge before turning out the souffles. They will deflate a little as they cool. To freeze: Once completely cool; cover in cling wrap and freeze. To make; defrost completely (do not use microwave); I usually do this by leaving them in the fridge overnight. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Place a soufflé on a gratin or pie dish (I used a tart dish); pour 1/4 of the cream over the top; scatter 1 tbsp grated cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bake for 15 minutes until puffed up and the cream is bubbly and golden. Serve immediately.
